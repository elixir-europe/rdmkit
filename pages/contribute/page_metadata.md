title: Page metadata
---


In order to render the website, each markdown file contains a specific frontmatter/metadata section. This section is located at the top of the markdown file, is delimited by two times `---` and contains all key value pairs. This can be seen as settings on pagelevel to enable/disable certain page functions are to deliver extra information which can be displayed in a structured way. An example of how this can look like:

```yaml
---
title: Title of the page
---
```

## Possible metadata attributes of a page


* `title`: Specify here the title of the page. This wil be the H1 title (replacing the top level title using the # in markdown )

* `description`: Short sentence about the page starting with a lowercase. This sentence is visualized when pages are automatically listed using a tag.

* `contributors`: list here all the contributors that helped in establishing the page. This will be the full name of the person. Make sure that the person name that is listed can be found in the CONTRIBUTORS.yaml file in the _data directory if you want to link the github id and other contact information.

* `search_exclude`: by setting this field true, the page will not end up in the search results of the searchbar. By default this is false.

* `sitemap`: let the page appear in the sitemap.xml. Default: true

* `no_robots`: by setting this field to true, the page will not end up in the search results of google or any other search engine.

* `toc`: When set to false, the table of contents in the beginning of the page will not be generated.

* `page_id`: Unique identifier of a page. It is usually a shortened version of the page name or title, with small letters and spaces, or an acronym, with capital and small letters. Used to list Related pages.

* `datatable`: use this attribute to activate the pagination + sorting + searching in tables

* `affiliations`: List here all affiliations related to the page. Make sure that the person name that is listed can be found in the _data/affiliations.yaml file. These affiliations will get displayed at the bottom of the page and in the section navigation tile of the page.

### Related pages

* `related_pages`: List here the `page_id` of {{site.title}} pages that you want to display as Related pages, grouped by section.

  If you want pages from the specific section (Your tasks, Your domain, Tool assembly) to be shown here as Related pages, list their `page_id`. If you want to list multiple related pages, make sure to put them in a list like this: [page_id1, page_id2]. The specific sections allowed in each page are specified in each page template. Please, do not add extra sections in the metadata of the page.

  ```yml
  related_pages: 
    - Your_tasks: [page_id1, page_id2]
    - Your_domain: [page_id1, page_id2]
    - Tool_assembly: [page_id1, page_id2]
  ```
