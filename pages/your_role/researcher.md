## Introduction
Your research data is a major output from your research project, it supports your research conclusions, and guides yourself and others towards future research. Therefore, managing the data well throughout the project, and sharing it, is a crucial aspect of research.

## Data management responsibilities

Data management includes actions throughout all stages of the research process. 

In your role of researcher, you may need to:

 * Write a data management plan;
 * Estimate the costs of data management for a grant application;
 * Ensure your data complies with ethical, policy and legal requirements;
 * Store your data securely, in a resource that is sustained and accessible;
 * Use metadata standards and documentation methods for your data;
 * Get training about data management, including the use of data management tools and data archives.

## Data management guidance

### RDMkit pages

 * [The RDM life cycle pages](data_life_cycle) give an overview of how to approach data management tasks.
 * [Data management plan](data_management_plan) guides you through writing a data management plan.
 * [Costs of data management](costs_data_management) helps you budget for your project.
 * [Compliance](compliance_monitoring) helps you comply with the institution policy, including the legal and ethical aspects.
 * [National resources](national_resources) give country-specific guidance and resources.
 * [Documentation and metadata](metadata_management) helps you document data and choose the appropriate metadata standards.
 * [Data publication](data_publication) guides to find a data repository for your needs.
