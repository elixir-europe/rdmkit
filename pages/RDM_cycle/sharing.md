## What is Data Sharing?
Data Sharing datasets means making datasets known and available to the whole world and society.
Does not have to happen immediately, while you are still working on the project. Data can be shared after your scientific paper is published.

## Why Data Sharing is important?
Data Management Planning will facilitate the progress of your project, as you can prepare early on. Data Management Planning will also help you to get funded, as this is a critical part of the proposal and/or the contract for many funders and a good Data Management Plan (DMP) will show and improve the feasability of your project.

## What should be considered for Data Sharing?
* [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2017)](https://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017.pdf) states that “Researchers, research institutions and organisations ensure access to data is as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.
* Research funders, institutions and reputable journals/publishers with data sharing mandates will normally allow you to opt out of their open data requirements only for legitimate reasons (see below).
* Additional reasons to share your datasets:
  - [Ten reasons to share your data](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/ten-reasons-to-share-your-data)
  - [Ask not what you can do for open data; ask what open data can do for you](http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2017/06/19/ask-not-what-you-can-do-for-open-data-ask-what-open-data-can-do-for-you/)
* Good reasons to close or restrict access to your datasets
  - Ethical issues.
  - Personal data.
  - Sensitive data that could potentially cause harm (e.g. to endangered species, vulnerable sites or groups, public health, national security…) if made public. Some personal data are considered sensitive personal data.
  - Legal or contractual issues:
    - Confidential data (you have a duty or agreed to keep the data confidential).
    - Third-party data (data are not generated in the course of your own research project, but are supplied to you by another party).  
    - Copyright and/or database right data.
    - Data with potential economic/commercial value.
If you want to close or restrict access to your datasets, you must explain your ethical and/or legal issues in the Data Management Plan. You can ask help to the Legal Team, Tech Transfer Office or Data Protection Officer of your institute.

## What Tools and Resources are available for Data Sharing?
* For finding appropriate repositories by type of data, there are extensive lists and selection tools in the following locations:
  - For Biomolecular Data in Life Science use one of the [ELIXIR Deposition Databases](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases), or use the [EBI Guidance Wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) 
  - [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)
  - [Re3data](https://re3data.org/)
  - [Repositories recommended by Nature publishing group](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
* For the sharing of human-subject phenotype/genotype data there are well-established repositories ([EGA](https://ega-archive.org/), [dbGAP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), [JGA](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/jga/index-e.html)). The choice will depend on the conditions under which data has been donated and the legislative/geographic boundaries for the research project/consortium. There are also community-specific data hubs that may implement a controlled-access model e.g. ORPHANET, MJFF
