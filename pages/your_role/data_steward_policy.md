## Description
As a policy data steward, I focus on policy development and the implementation of research data management practices in my organisation. I work in close collaboration with directors, policy makers and funders, and I help establish suitable and sufficient data stewardship services and infrastructure.

It is my job to coordinate and align efforts on the quality, security and management of my organisation’s data, thus effectively supporting the research process. I have a good knowledge of local, national and international procedures and regulations, such as my institution’s research code, national codes of conduct or the EU privacy legislation. I translate these general concepts into practical guidelines for my organisation, and coordinate their implementation and monitoring.

## Focus
* Advise, develop and monitor a research data management (RDM) policy institutionally or nationally
* Ensure compliance of the RDM policy to codes of conduct and regulations, including ethical and legal compliance
* Align the RDM policy to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and the principles of Open Science
* Organise RDM support into a set of services
* Identify the requirements of adequate data-infrastructure for RDM to comply with the institute's RDM policy and alignment to (inter)national data-infrastructure and tools
* Determine the adequate level of knowledge and skills on RDM
* Maintain a network of aligned RDM expertise inside and outside the organisation
* Identify the requirements of adequate support and data infrastructure for FAIR and long-term archiving of data

## Learning path
Institutes across Europe have started hiring professional data stewards. A policy oriented data steward is expected to be competent in the following areas:
* Develop, implement, monitor and evaluate policies regarding research data that are endorsed by researchers and aligned with internal and external stakeholders and effectuate change management
* Communicate about the FAIR data and Open Science principles to researchers, support staff and relevant stakeholders, thus creating awareness within institutes and organisations
* Give advice on RDM and formats for data management plans (DMP) to a broad audience
* Communicate about the RDM policy, explain implications and create awareness
* Translate RDM policy and legislation and codes of conduct concerning research data into practical implications and guidelines for that researchers can understand
* Formulate requirements for RDM support (staff and services)
* Assess and analyse needs from researchers regarding support on RDM for researchers and define new requirements
* Assess RDM knowledge and skills and identify gaps among researchers and relevant stakeholders
