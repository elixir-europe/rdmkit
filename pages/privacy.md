The information is collected anonymously and aggregated. We cannot identify you from the information gathered, or track your web browsing outside of this site.

## Why we collect the data
We collect the data so that we can then generate reports about the site for our funders. We also collect the date to help us improve the site, and ensure we design the site for the browsers and devices that most people are using.

## Who has access to the data
The data collected from you visit to the site is sent to Google but aggregated and anonymised. We do not have access to personally identifiable information, but Google records and stores your IP address in order to generate the site statistics.

See [Google Analytics cookies information](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage) and [Google's Safeguarding your data article](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en).
