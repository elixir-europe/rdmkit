## Applies to
PhD candidates, research grant applicants, project managers, group leaders, PIs

## Scenario
The funding organisation I am applying to requires a data management plan (DMP). I have little experience in writing a DMP, and I am not sure of the level of detail I am required to provide. I have limited access to data management experts within my institution. I am considering using the RDMkit for my data management needs. I also hope to find useful references to local training about data management requirements, data archives and DMP tools.

I know the types and the approximate amount of data I will generate, but I have not thought about how to share data with my collaborators and how to store data securely. Initially, my plan was to buy a powerful computer and portable hard drive, but I am now thinking that I need to use a national computing infrastructure. The field I work in has well defined data and curation standards, for example, capturing information (metadata) about how to collect and sample my data. However, I am not yet familiar with the importance of storing provenance data, such as tool and database versions used in analysis.


## Focus

* Write data management plans, also in the context of grant applications
* Ensure compliance with institution policy, including legal and ethical aspects
* Ensure proper data organisation and storage
* Ensure secure sharing, reproducibility and preservation of data
* Transmits the good practices in RDM to his group

## Getting started

* Check out the various steps of the [RDM life cycle](index), in particular the [planning](planning) stage
* Identify and contact the data steward in your local organisation or your national contact in the [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge/wp1/dm-coordinators) network
* Start planning your project taking the [DMP](data_management_plan) into account
