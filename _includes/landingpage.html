  Are you working with data in the Life Sciences? Do you feel overwhelmed when you think about Research Data Management?
</h1>
<p>The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit) is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the
    beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, the RDMkit has
    guidelines, information, and pointers to help you with problems throughout the dataâ€™s life cycle. RDMkit supports FAIR data &mdash; Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable &mdash; by-design, from the first steps of data management planning to the final steps of depositing data in public archives.
</p>
<p>
  The RDMkit organises information into the six sections displayed below, which are interconnected but can be browsed independently.
