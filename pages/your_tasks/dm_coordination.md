## How to organize data management in collaborative projects?
 
### Description

Most national and European funders of (multiparty) projects now require Data management plans (DMPs) that are evaluated before grant awards. Therefore, coordinators of project consortia need to mobilise a dedicated effort to decide on the approach for data management, developing the DMP, using the DMP as a live document over the course of  the project, etc, to ensure that the research outputs from the project follow the FAIR principles. This is new terrain for many people, requiring them to grasp what this entails and figure out who to approach.

### Considerations

* During the writing stage of a grant proposal, members of a multi partners project or consortium need to agree on how to address data management during (and after) the project, and formalise the way of working in the proposal.
* What information regarding data management is needed at different phases (preparation, submission, execution, wrap up, reporting to the funders) in the project needs to be decided in advance.
* There is a need to understand the institutional landscape in terms of legal requirements, data policies, IT services, etc. that are needed to carry out the project. They might vary among individual institutions in the project consortium:
  * Not every institution has a centralised IT department to support data management; often data management is carried out by the group itself without help from the IT department.
  * Legal and ethical requirements, data policies, etc. can be very different or even not be in place in some institutions.
* Data management strategies and the types of data generated can change during the project.


### Solutions

Here, we provide some advice and methods to help consortia with data management coordination tasks.

* In a consortium, establishing a Data Management Working Group (DMWG) should be one of the first actions done during the establishment of the consortium. Each partner should have a representative for data management, especially the partners that will generate and/or use a higher volume of data. If possible, the representatives should have a working knowledge of data management. During the writing stage, the DMWG should be responsible for deciding how data management will be addressed during (and after) the project.
* If applicable, the establishment of the DMWG can be included as a project task, deliverable or milestone. Each partner should allocate personnel time for the DMWG. Dedicating part of the project (a work package, for instance) to data management helps with clarifying tasks and responsibilities. The DMWG should have defined milestones and deliverables in the project plan.
* All partners should agree on what needs to be added to the budget for data management purposes: hardware requirements (long-term storage space, servers, etc.), cloud services, software licensing, software developers, and data stewards/managers (costs of making data FAIR). It is advisable to consult with available IT support, data centers, and instrument providers at each partner’s side to evaluate options and costs.
* DMWG should list the types of data to be collected, including descriptions of file types (to enable archive and sharing) and estimated file sizes (to enable storage costing).
* Ideally, the DMWG should agree on: data deposition databases, data sharing and archiving, and metadata standards (model, checklist, format, ontologies and controlled vocabularies) during the writing of the proposal. However, if it is not feasible at the writing stage, making these decisions can be added as early tasks, milestones or deliverables of the project.
* As a monitoring mechanism, some of the milestones and deliverables should be the successful creation of datasets with their metadata and possibly their deposition.
* If applicable, each partner (actually, its representative) should consult with personal data legislation experts (e.g. GDPR or equivalent), Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and the legal office of the institution (e.g. for technology transfer) to reach a consensus at the consortium level about data protection, availability and open science.
* It is recommended to discuss as early as possible the licensing and the intellectual property (IP) rights of project outcomes (datasets, software, tools, etc), in order to comply with open science requirements and to avoid legal issues later on. 
* Discuss a common plan for the sharing of data, metadata and documentation between partners.
