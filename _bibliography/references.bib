  doi                   = {10.1038/s44185-023-00013-7},
  author    = "Mc Cartney, Ann M and Head, M A and Tsosie, K S and Sterner, B

  abstract  = "The aim to sequence, catalog, and characterize the genomes of
               all of Earth's eukaryotic biodiversity is the shared mission of
               many ongoing large-scale biodiversity genomics initiatives.
               Reference genomes of global flora and fauna have the potential
               to inform a broad range of major issues facing both biodiversity
               and humanity, such as the impact of climate change, the
               conservation of endangered species and ecosystems, public health
               crises, and the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem
               services. Biodiversity is dramatically declining: 28\% of
               species being assessed by the IUCN are threatened with
               extinction, and recent reports suggest that a transformative
               change is needed to conserve and protect what remains. To
               provide a collective and global genomic response to the
               biodiversity crisis, many biodiversity genomics initiatives have
               come together, creating a network of networks under the Earth
               BioGenome Project. This network seeks to expedite the creation
               of an openly available, ``public good'' encyclopedia of
               high-quality eukaryotic reference genomes, in the hope that by
               advancing our basic understanding of nature, it can lead to the
               transformational scientific developments needed to conserve and
               protect global biodiversity. Key to completing this ambitious
               encyclopedia of reference genomes, is the ability to
               responsibly, ethically, legally, and equitably access and use

              to this challenge, the Task Group (TG) for Sustainable DwC-MIxS
              Interoperability was established. Convening experts from the
              Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and the Genomic
              Standards Consortium (GSC) alongside external stakeholders, the
              TG aimed to promote sustainable interoperability between the
              Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) and Darwin Core
              (DwC) specifications. To achieve this goal, the TG utilized the
              Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings (SSSOM) to create a
              comprehensive mapping of DwC keys to MIxS keys. This mapping,
              combined with the development of the MIxS-DwC extension, enables

              user communities. Through the implementation of this translation
              layer, data produced in either MIxS- or DwC-compliant formats can
              now be efficiently brokered, breaking down silos and fostering

              communities. To ensure its sustainability and lasting impact,
              TDWG and GSC have both signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)

  abstract  = "Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the
               identification of known species is often difficult, interim
               taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity
               analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species,
               called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed
               investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable
               studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have
               conventionally been separated through their morphological
               divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but
               have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated,
               data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared
               among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to
               develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the
               animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide
               variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I
               (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between
               groups of specimens identified to a species through prior
               taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI
               sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established
               (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes
               the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode
               Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in
               biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by
               flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating
               geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for
               specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if
               it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now
               available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned
               for rapid growth.",

                  the need for repetitive and scalable data processing, sharing
                  of processing know-how, and transparent methods. As both
                  combined records of analysis and descriptions of processing
                  steps, workflows should be reproducible, reusable, adaptable,
                  and available. Workflow sharing presents opportunities to
                  reduce unnecessary reinvention, promote reuse, increase
                  access to best practice analyses for non-experts, and
                  increase productivity. In reality, workflows are scattered
                  and difficult to find, in part due to the diversity of
                  available workflow engines and ecosystems, and because
                  workflow sharing is not yet part of research practice.
                  WorkflowHub provides a unified registry for all computational
                  workflows that links to community repositories, and supports
                  both the workflow lifecycle and making workflows findable,

                  interoperating with diverse platforms, services, and external

                  sharing, explicitly assigning credit, enhancing FAIRness, and
                  promoting workflows as scholarly artefacts. The registry has
                  a global reach, with hundreds of research organisations
