## What is Data Management Planning?

Data management planning means to formally outline solutions regarding the handling and storing of the data generated within a project, both as the activity is running and after its conclusion. The first step is the creation of Data Management Plan (DMP), a document reporting in detail the data types that will be generated, the associated metadata, the plan for data preservation, the type of analysis that will be performed, data ownership and licensing.

## Why is Data Management Planning important?

It is good research practice to take care of your research data and have a data management plan. It will make your work more efficient, facilitate team work and use of services and tools. Moreover, a detailed DMP would facilitate the reproducibilty of your research results, both in your group and externally. 

Data management planning:

* helps to plan and budget necessary resources and equipment.
* defines roles and responsibilities in data management among the project team.
* helps to identify risks in data handling and apply solutions at early stage.
* facilitates data sharing, reuse and preservation.
* is often a requirement of research organisations and funders.


## What should be considered for Data Management Planning?
Data management should be planned in the early stages of a research project. Preferably, the DMP should be filled in before starting data collection. However, the DMP is a living document and should be updated as the research project progresses to match e.g. an update of the infrastructures, research sofwares or a novel collaboration.

Funders often require a DMP as part of the application for grants or, latest, when the project is funded. There are many guidelines, policies and tools for data management planning. Find recommendations and obtain help from your home institution support services.


### Deciding for a DMP tool

The usage of web-based DMP solutions is becoming standard practice. Their usage is recommended as they provide both ready-to-use templates and guidance regarding state-of-the-art solutions. These tools usually enable sharing of the DMP with your collaborators as well as exporting it in several formats.

Some tools support machine actionable DMPs (maDMP), which enable you to transfer information between different tools and systems.
MaDMPs aim to make the DMP interoperable, automated and increasingly standardised.

DMP can also be written as a plain text document, if preferred.
