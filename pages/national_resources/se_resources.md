## Introduction 

This page provides a general overview of national resources on research data management (RDM) in Sweden, directed towards researchers and official collaborators. National goals and long term data management achievements are provided in the [**Research Bill 2020/21-60**](https://www.regeringen.se/4af915/contentassets/da8732af87a14b689658dadcfb2d3777/forskning-frihet-framtid--kunskap-och-innovation-for-sverige.pdf).
The Swedish ELIXIR node National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden ([**NBIS**](https://nbis.se/)) offers support and training in data management to life science researchers in Sweden, in collaboration with the [**Data Centre**](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/) at Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab).

## Funders with policies

The [**Swedish Research Council**](https://www.vr.se/) has a government mandate to coordinate and promote Sweden’s work on introducing [**open access**](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data/the-swedish-research-councils-recommendation.html) to research data, with the goal for transition to open access to research data to be fully implemented by 2026. As of 2019 all who receive grants from the council must have a data management plan (DMP), written according to their [**DMP template**](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/producing-a-data-management-plan/data-management-plan-template.html), which is a partially reworked version of Science Europe’s "Core Requirements for Data Management Plans".

[**Formas**](https://formas.se/) - The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning - has a [**policy**](https://formas.se/download/18.7357e3f3168752d5a10c7f7/1549956105856/Beslut_policy_oppna_data.pdf) on open access to research data, and requires that a [**DMP**](https://formas.se/soka-finansiering/sa-har-gar-det-till/att-kanna-till-nar-du-skriver-en-ansokan.html) is written and can be shown upon request.

## Authorities and Regulations

If personal data is processed in your research, contact your institute’s Data Protection Officer, and if available, the Research Data Office (see list at end of page), for guidance on ethical and legal compliance. The following is a list of ethical and legal committees, authorities and regulations of interest:

### Authorities

* [Swedish Ethical Review Authority](https://etikprovningsmyndigheten.se/)
* [Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY)](https://www.imy.se/en/)

### Regulations

* [The Ethics Review Act](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2003460-om-etikprovning-av-forskning-som_sfs-2003-460) (in Swedish)
* [The Patient Data Act](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/patientdatalag-2008355_sfs-2008-355) (in Swedish)
* [The Biobank Act](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2002297-om-biobanker-i-halso--och_sfs-2002-297) (in Swedish)
* [The Archives Act](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/arkivlag-1990782_sfs-1990-782) (in Swedish)
* [Lag (2018:218) med kompletterande bestämmelser till EU:s dataskyddsförordning](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-2018218-med-kompletterande-bestammelser_sfs-2018-218)

## Domain-specific infrastructures and resources 

The [**SciLifeLab Data Centre**](https://www.scilifelab.se/data)  provides services for IT and data management, including Data Stewardship Wizard instance (for writing data management plans), the Swedish COVID-19 data portal, and the SciLifeLab Data Repository. 

Data stewards at [**NBIS**](https://nbis.se/) (ELIXIR-SE) provide consultation and support services regarding data management questions, including e.g. guidance when writing data management plans and when doing submissions to domain-specific repositories. For information about this and other resources at NBIS please see the [**Data Management**](https://nbis.se/infrastructure/data-management/) page. An upcoming resource is the [**Swedish Sensitive Data Archive**](https://nbis.se/infrastructure/sensitive-data-archive.html), a secure data archive and sharing platform for sensitive datasets, which will be integrated with the [**Federated EGA network**](https://ega-archive.org/federated).

The [**Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing**](https://snic.se/) (SNIC) is a national research infrastructure that provides resources and user support for large scale computation and data storage to meet the needs of researchers from all scientific disciplines and from all over Sweden. Of particular use for life science researchers is the [**SNIC-SENS**](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/projects-and-collaborations/snic-sens/) project which provides high-performance computing resources for analyzing sensitive data.

[**Swedish National Data Service**](https://snd.gu.se/en) (SND) with its network of almost 40 higher education institutions and public research institutes, provides researchers with a coordinated and quality-assured system for finding, describing, and sharing research data, nationally as well as internationally. The [**SND network**](https://snd.gu.se/en/about-us/snd-network) has agreed to create local units for managing research data (Data Access Units (DAUs)), with the main task to assist researchers in their respective organisation in making research data as accessible as possible, via training and support in data management. SND also provides a [**DMP checklist**](https://snd.gu.se/en/manage-data/guides/dmp-checklist) to support researchers in writing data management plans.
