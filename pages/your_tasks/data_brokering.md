## Getting started as a data broker
### Description
To acknowledge a research outcome, it is important to transfer the life science research data into appropriate repositories. Curating and transferring research data and metadata into relevant repositories is a messy and complex process which researchers can struggle with. A potential solution is to use data brokers (individuals or organizations). A broker is an agent for connecting research data to relevant databases. The job of a data broker is to provide expertise to submit data to relevant repositories on behalf of another person/institute. In many cases, a centralized national brokering facility is the most efficient means of data management at large scale.

### Considerations
* Data Transfer Use Agreement? (link to Licensing page)    
* Data transfer and processing agreement (link to GDPR)   
* Time and resources required for effective brokering.
* Access and rights to publish research data on behalf of researchers.
* Validating/fixing issues in the metadata and data before the submission

## Collecting and processing the metadata and data
### Description
Data brokering involves collecting data from various data providers, standardizing and curating the data if needed, and then preparing the data for sharing. At the broker, it is recommended that data be stored in a structured manner, using as much as possible controlled vocabularies and ontologies where they exist.

### Considerations
[Data collection](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/collecting) consists of collecting both metadata and additional data files (e.g. sequencing data).

Collection of metadata in particular can be done in various ways, each having its advantages and disadvantages. 

Data brokers should also consider implementing a mechanism for metadata and data files update.

* define what to receive (fields, compulsory vs optional), CV+ontologies, how we will store it (DB)

### Solutions
If you encounter hurdles, how to improve or solve them, whom to contact… (check checklists per domain)
* getting data: transfer-data page
* data harmonisation: ensure data quality (CV, ontologies). https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_quality.html
* check templates per domain, e.g. PHA4GE for SARS-CoV-2
* ENA sample metadata checklists search: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/checklists
