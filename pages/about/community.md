Welcome to the RDMkit community! 


The RDMkit community aims to foster the adoption, enhancement, and incorporation of Research Data Management (RDM) best practices collected on the RDMkit. Initially established as a component of the ELIXIR-CONVERGE project, the RDMkit community has experienced continuous growth, an esteemed editorial board, committed contributors, and a growing user base.
The community convenes under the RDMkit Club, a platform for collective engagement where members share experiences, address queries, troubleshoot issues, and stay updated on pertinent developments. Additionally, we maintain close collaboration with the [ELIXIR RDM Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/research-data-management).

- [**Contributors**](contributors)
- [**Editorial Board**](editorial_board)
