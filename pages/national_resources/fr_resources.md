## Introduction 

This is an overview of research data management resources in France. These resources are accessible for researchers in France and to their collaborators.

The french governement has set up the ["Committee for Open Science"](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/home/), which brings together education and research stakeholders to support the implementation of the National Open Science Policy.
The second [national plan for open science](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/get-started-with-open-science/) has been released in 2021.


## Funders


- [National Research Agency (ANR) Open Science Policy](https://anr.fr/en/anrs-role-in-research/commitments/open-science/)
- [French Ministery of Higher Education and Research Open Science Plateform](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/category/resources/)



## Regulations

[JurisDoR](https://recherche.data.gouv.fr/en/actuality/jurisdor-centre-de-ressources-juridiques-donnees-de-la-recherche-en) website disseminates legal resources for research data management to the public and the scientific community.



## Infrastructures


- [RDA-France](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-france) is a subsection of RDA dedicated to the activities, news and events of the RDA French Node.

- [Recherche Data Gouv Repository](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/recherche-data-gouv-the-federated-national-research-data-platform/) The Recherche Data Gouv multidisciplinary repository is a sovereign solution for sharing and opening up data produced by communities that do not have a recognized disciplinary repository. It is based on the Dataverse software.

- [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr) is an open archive where authors can deposit scholarly documents from all academic fields.

- [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) goal is to collect and preserve software source codes.

- [DORANum](https://doranum.fr) is a training resource for best practices in data management and sharing.

- [National Infrastructures in Biology & Health (INBS)](https://www.insb.cnrs.fr/fr/infrastructures-nationales): research platforms that provide cutting-edge technologies, data, and services across fields such as genomics, bioinformatics, imaging, and clinical research. They form a coordinated network supporting national and European research, enabling collaboration, data sharing, and innovation in life and health sciences.

- [Data Terra](https://www.data-terra.org/) is a research infrastructure providing access to Earth observation, environmental and biodiversity data through thematic data hubs (atmosphere, land, ocean, solid Earth , continental surfaces and biodiversity). 


## National initiatives shaping research data policies and recommendations

- [Recherche Data Gouv](https://recherche.data.gouv.fr/en) 
Recherche Data Gouv is the national ecosystem dedicated to managing, sharing and opening up French research data.
By encouraging the reuse of data, Recherche Data Gouv stimulates innovation, avoids the dispersal of resources and promotes transdisciplinary approaches, which are essential to meeting complex challenges. Aligned with international standards, it enhances the visibility of French research and embodies an ambitious strategy for open science, benefiting researchers, citizens and economic players alike.
is a national federated research data platform.
  [ElIXIR FR](https://recherche.data.gouv.fr/en/page/disciplinary-competence-centers) is a Disciplinary Competence Center for life sciences and contribute to the french [tool assembly](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/ifb_assembly)
  [INIST] is in charge of OPIDoR (DMP OPIDoR, Cat OPIDoR, DORANum)

- [The Committee for Open Science CoSO](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/the-committee-for-open-science/) is a national committe which support the implementation of the National Open Science Policy.
Its core responsibilities include coordinating the national strategy, developing open science skills, steering France’s European and international engagement, defining orientations for the National Open Science Fund, and guiding negotiations with major scientific publishers.

- [The committee of services and digital infrastructures, CoSIN](https://collection-numerique.amue.fr/numero-35/28.html) supports the digital transformation of Higher Education and Research by developing environmentally responsible infrastructures, pooling expertise, and supporting national and European strategic projects.
