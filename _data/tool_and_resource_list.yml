    through combination of heterogeneous complementary strategies from term co-mention,
    rules, and patterns to machine learning-based text classification. It also provides
    indirect associations to hepatotoxicity through the extraction of relations reflecting
    the effect of compounds at the level of metabolism and liver enzymes.
