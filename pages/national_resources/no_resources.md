## Introduction

This page provides an overview of the data management resources in Norway. The target audience is the Norwegian scientific community in the life sciences and collaborators.
The [Data Stewardship Wizard instance from ELIXIR Norway](https://norway.dsw.elixir-europe.org/wizard/knowledge-models/elixir.no:lifesciences-elixir-norway:latest/preview) provides an interactive way to navigate these recommendations and resources. You can also find condensed information in the interlinked [RDM LookUp from ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no/rdm-lookup/).

<!---General RDM considerations for your country, how to deal with RDM on a national level--->
The Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research's "[National strategy on access to and sharing of research data](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/national-strategy-on-access-to-and-sharing-of-research-data/id2582412/?ch=1)" from 2018 is an initiative aimed at fostering open, equitable, and efficient sharing of research data in Norway. For researchers in Norway and their international partners, this strategy lays the groundwork for creating a robust, collaborative research environment where data is shared freely but responsibly. The national strategy underscores Norway's commitment to scientific advancement and maintaining ethical and legal standards in a data-driven era.

##  Funder policies on research data

[Norges Forskningsråd (Research Council of Norway)](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/) is the primary funding body in Norway for research. The [research data management policy of RCN requires a Data Management Plan (DMP)](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/research-data/), preferably also available in the [DMP Common Standard](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/dmp-common-standards-wg/outcomes/rda-dmp-common-standard-machine-actionable-data-management) as supported by for example by {% tool "data-stewardship-wizard" %} after a positive funding decision for each project. A DMP has to be submitted as part of a final report. RCN recommends following the ‘[Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management](https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/practical-guide-to-the-international-alignment-of-research-data-management/)’ by Science Europe, the organisation of research funders and performers. In addition to advising [policies for open science and open access](https://www.forskningsradet.no/siteassets/forskningspolitisk-radgivning/apen-forskning/nfr-policy-open-science-eng.pdf), [RCN provides recommendations on how to make research data available](https://www.forskningsradet.no/siteassets/publikasjoner/2021/how-should-we-share-research-data.v2.pdf). From 2023 and onwards, a [project grant application submitted to RCN is assessed for open science best practices](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/processing-grant-applications/processing-applications/assessment-open-science/).

### Institutional storage guidelines

Most universities in Norway classify data into four categories, depending on access requirements. These categories are based on recommendations from [SIKT](https://cms.sikt.no/sites/default/files/2023-02/Sektorstandard_klassifisering_av_informasjon%20%281%29.pdf).
* **Open (Green)**: Information can be available to everyone, without special access rights.
* **Restricted (Yellow)**: Information must have some protections if access by unauthorised persons could harm the institution or collaborators in some way. The information can be available both internally and externally with controlled access rights.
* **Confidential (Red)**: Information must have strict access rights if unauthorised access would cause damage to public interests, individuals, the institution, or collaborators.
* **Strictly confidential (Black)**: Information must have the strictest access rights if unauthorised access could cause significant damage (for example, highly confidential research or confidential addresses).

### Communities for research data management support personnel

There are several RDM communities (with subject or local focus) in Norway to enable exchange and discussion:
 

* [Life-Science RDM Group](https://elixir.no/organization/biomeddata/Life-Science-RDM-Group)
* [RDA Norway](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-norway)
* [University of Oslo Data Manager Network](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/data-managers-network/)

* DataverseNO Network of Expertise
* [FAIR Data Forum by Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)](https://neic.no/fairdataforum/)
* [Sensitive Data Forum by NeIC](https://neic.no/sensitivedataforum/)




## Data Management Planning
A data management plan (DMP) is currently requested by:
* The research performing institutions 
* RCN upon project funding
* International funding programs (e.g. Horizon Europe, European Research Council)

A DMP typically contains information about data handling during a project and after its completion and makes it possible to identify (and budget for) significant issues to be resolved (e.g. storage). While some of the institutions mentioned above require DMPs to follow a certain standard, this does not apply to all local institutions (e.g. [UiO does not currently enforce any specific template](https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data-management/write-a-dmp.html)). There are several tools available for creating a DMP. 

<!-- Some of these tools come from international providers (e.g. DMPonline), some are national services, such as EasyDMP (Sigma2) and sikt’s DMP tool. -->

ELIXIR Norway provides access to a [national instance of the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW)](https://norway.dsw.elixir-europe.org/wizard/), an internationally developed tool that has been adapted to better suit the needs of Norwegian researchers, PIs, and institutions. Both [RCN]((https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Adviser-research-policy/open-science/open-access-to-research-data/)) and [BOTT (Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Tromsø) university libraries](https://zenodo.org/record/7428542) list the DSW as a preferred tool, particularly for life sciences data. DSW provides templates that are compliant with all different funders' regulations and offers machine-actionable DMP exports. To facilitate the adoption of best-practises, the ELIXIR-NO DSW instance also provides a collection of exemplar DMPs. These DMPs are partially pre-filled with domain-specific recommendations and can be used as a starting point for your own projects.


## Life science-specific infrastructures/resources

We have included here both general and topic-specific resources, that help to simplify and streamline data management practices and to protect your research data. These resources can help you increase productivity while ensuring that your research is compliant, transparent, and reproducible.

### Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS) tool assembly
