## What is Data Collection?

Data collection is the process where information is gathered about specific variables of interest either using instrumentation or other methods. While data collection methods depend on the field and research subject, it is important to ensure data quality.

You can also reuse existing data in your project, for more information see “Reuse” in the data life cycle.

* Instrument calibration
* If you work with sensitive or confidential data, take care of data protection and security issues.
* If you work with human-related data, think about permissions, consent
* How will you store the data?
* Where will you store the data?
