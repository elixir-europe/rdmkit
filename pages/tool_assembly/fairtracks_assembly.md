## What is the FAIRtracks tool assembly?

The [FAIRtracks ecosystem](https://fairtracks.net/) is a set of services associated with a minimal
[metadata model](https://fairtracks.net/standards/#standards-01-fairtracks) for
[genomic annotations/tracks](https://fairtracks.net/tracks/#tracks-01-genomic-tracks),
implemented as a [set of JSON Schemas](https://github.com/fairtracks/fairtracks_standard/tree/master/json/schema).
The FAIRtracks model contains metadata fields particularly useful for data discovery,
harmonised through strict adherence to a selection of ontologies available through the {%tool "ontology-lookup-service" %}.
The usability of the model can be expanded through referencing the original records via Compact Uniform Resource Identifiers (CURIEs) 
resolvable by {% tool "identifiers-org" %}.

In the context of the Data Life Cycle and its stages, the FAIRtracks ecosystem covers [Collecting](collecting), [Processing](processing),
[Analysing](analysing), [Sharing](sharing), and [Reusing](reusing). It has to be noted, however, that the FAIRtracks ecosystem is structured
around a secondary data life cycle, as illustrated in Figure 1. As part of this secondary life cycle, the annotation/track data gets further distributed
and its discovery is enhanced through derived metadata. The FAIRtracks ecosystem aims at harmonising this process.
Primary data needs to be handled independently following domain best practices
(see e.g. the pages on [Single cell sequencing](single_cell_sequencing), [Plant sciences](plant_sciences), or [Rare disease data](rare_disease_data)).

The FAIRtracks ecosystem is developed and provided as part of the national Service Delivery Plans by
[ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no/) and [ELIXIR Spain](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/spain),
and is supported by the [Track Hub Registry group](https://trackhubregistry.org/) at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/).
FAIRtracks is endorsed by [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/) as a
[Recommended Interoperability Resource](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/rirs).

## Who can use the FAIRtracks tool assembly?

There is no central authentication solution for the FAIRtracks services requiring login.
The entire FAIRtracks ecosystem is available to everyone.
Most of the services are accessible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). More details are provided in the description below.
Users of the FAIRtracks ecosystem belong to different categories, which could be summarised as:

- Researchers and data analysts
- Data providers and biocurators
- Developers working on tooling for
  - Research
  - Implementation of the FAIR data principles

Each of these categories benefits specifically from a subset of the global ecosystem.
The core services can be accessed both upstream (for data providers and biocurators) and downstream (for tool developers and analytical end users).

## For what can you use the FAIRtracks tool assembly?

The FAIRtracks tool assembly can be used for a large number of applications; we summarise the main ones below following the steps of the data life-cycle
and focusing on particular tools. 

While the assembly does not include a tool for [Data Management Planning](dmp),
the FAIRtracks metadata standard is registered in {%tool "fairsharing" %}
and, thus, formally connected to several other standards and databases.
The FAIRtracks standard can, thus, be selected on your Data Management Plan in all the instances of {% tool "data-stewardship-wizard" %} through
the integration with {%tool "fairsharing" %}. 

{%tool "omnipy" %} is a high-level Python library for type-driven data wrangling and scalable data flow orchestration;
it is a self-standing subset of the FAIRtracks ecosystem covering several steps in the data life-cicle.
It can be used to extract metadata from specific portals and for [Processing](processing) of metadata entries to harmonise them into a unique model.
{%tool "omnipy" %} data flows are defined as transformations from specific input data models to specific output data models.
Input and output data are validated at each iteration through parsing based on {%tool "pydantic" %}.
Offloading of  data flows to external compute resources is provided through the integration of {%tool "omnipy" %} with an orchestration engine based on {%tool "prefect" %}.

There is ongoing work into adding {%tool "prefect" %} as one of the services available in the
[National Infrastructure for Research Data (NIRD) service platform](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-service-platform).
This would enable running {%tool "omnipy" %} on data and metadata stored in the [NIRD data storage](https://www.sigma2.no/data-storage).
Refer also to the [Norwegian national page](no_resources) for more details. Note that, while the usage of NIRD storage and services
is certainly convenient for Norwegian users, this is not a central or mandatory part of the tool assembly which is born as an international
service and aims at maintaining this status.

Data [Sharing](sharing) and preservation is one of the key components of the FAIRtracks ecosystem.
Since genomic annotations/tracks typically consist of secondary data files referring to primary data sources,
they are often deposited together with the primary data. The aim of the minimal metadata model is to
offer a greater level of granularity, providing each track with an identifier and enabling the possibility of analysis across datasets
in an automatised fashion. A dedicated registry would typically be required to accomplish this. Given that such a registry does not yet exist,
the current recommendation is to deposit FAIRtracks-compliant metadata files to {%tool "zenodo" %},
as this platform supports both Digital Object Identifier (DOI) versioning and DOI reservation before publication.
The identifiers on the metadata FAIRtracks object are then cross-linked with the actual data which is hosted
e.g. in a [Track Hub](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html) and registered in
the {%tool "track-hub-registry" %}.

Data and metadata organised in this fashion can be discovered for [Reusing](reusing) through {%tool "trackfind" %},
a search and curation engine for genomic tracks.
{%tool "trackfind" %} will import FAIRtracks-compliant metadata from e.g. {%tool "zenodo" %}. 
This metadata can be accessed through hierarchical browsing or by search queries both through a web-based user interface and as a RESTful API.
TrackFind supports advanced SQL-based queries that can be easily built into the user interface.

Additional tools that comprise the core of the FAIRtracks ecosystem are the
[metadata validation](https://fairtracks.net/services/?category=Core%20services&tags%5B0%5D=Metadata%20validation) and the
[metadata augmentation](https://fairtracks.net/services/?category=Core%20services&tags%5B0%5D=Metadata%20augmentation) services.
The former is REST API that extends the standard JSON Schema validation technology to
e.g. validate ontology terms or check CURIEs against the registered entries.
The [FAIRtracks augmentation service](https://fairtracks.net/services/?category=Core%20services&tags%5B0%5D=Metadata%20augmentation)
is implemented as a REST API that expands on the information contained in a minimal FAIRtracks JSON by adding
a set of fields with human-readable values including ontology labels, versions, and summaries.
This service bridges the gap between data providers, which are required to submit only minimal information, and data consumers
who require richer information for data discovery and retrieval.
