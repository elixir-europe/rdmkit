## Introduction 
This page provides a general overview of national resources and initiatives on research data management (RDM) in Cyprus

## Funders
The [Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF)](https://www.research.org.cy/en/) is the national authority in charge of supporting and promoting research, technological development and innovation in Cyprus.

## Regulations
The [Cypurs National Policy of the Republic of Cyprus for Open Science Practices (PDF document)](https://www.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/research.nsf/All/877E9BEBAF67EE6CC2258859003DF656/$file/%CE%95%CE%B8%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%20%CE%A0%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%20%CE%91%CE%BD%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%82%20%CE%95%CF%80%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%82.pdf?) was recently revised to include research data management and planning.

The [Cyprus National Bioethics Committee](http://www.bioethics.gov.cy/moh/cnbc/cnbc.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument) (document EEBK3). 
All medical records and biological material are kept under secure conditions at a specially prepared 
Biobank suite with absolute confidentiality and protection of sensitive data of personal character,

## Domain-specific infrastructures or resources

The [Cyprus National Initiatives for Open Science in Europe – NI4OS Europe](https://ni4os.eu/overview/), aims to be a core contributor to the [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/) service portfolio, commit to EOSC governance and ensure inclusiveness on the European level for enabling global Open Science

The [Cyprus Institite of Neurology and Genetics (CING)](https://www.cing.ac.cy/) acted as a hub for COVID-19 data during the pandemic. CING was involved in biosample collection and high-throughput data analysis of samples using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).

The development of the [Cyprus Biobank](http://www.biobank.cy/) came with the success in funding by the European Commission in the framework of 
program H2020-WIDESPREAD-01-2018-2019: Teaming Phase 2, for €15mi for 7 years. 
The project is entitled: Biobanking and the Cyprus Human Genome Project. The project 
is supplemented by another €15mi by the Government of Cyprus and another €8mi by the 
University of Cyprus for a duration of 15 years, October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2034. 
It aims to upgrade the current infrastructure into a Center of Excellence in Biobanking and Biomedical Research.
