<!-- Please take in mind our style guide https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/style_guide when writing the content of this page. -->

## Introduction

<!--- In this section you should provide a brief overview of the domain from the data management perspective, mentioning and putting into context the challenges that are particular to the domain, which will be the object of sections below. --->


## section 1 title
 
### Description
<!--- Sections within Domain pages (aside from "Introduction" at the start and "Tools and resources on this page" at the end) should focus on particular data management problems, which should be described in this first sub-section.
For problems that are fully domain-specific, a detailed description is merited.
For detailing the domain-specific challenges of a problem that is generic, please link to the corresponding generic Problem page before going into the domain-specific challenges. --->

### Considerations <!--- (optional) --->
<!---  Direct and concise considerations, structured in bullet points and typically framed as questions RDMkit reader should ask themselves in order to arrive at the best solution among those listed below. One level of nesting of bullet points within considerations is fine, but more levels should be avoided. --->


### Solutions
<!--- Detail, either in normal text or in bullet points, the domain-specific solutions to the problem. Do not merely list tools or resources, as they will be automatically listed in the bottom section, but you can and should mention tools and resources listed below if you detail their usage to solve the problem. --->

<!--- ## Section 2 Title --->
<!--- Add more sections as needed, with the same subsections as above. --->

## What is ML (in this page)
 
### Description
The definition of Machine Learning (ML) can become so vague that it can reach the point of becoming a philosophical question. There are two main approaches; the first one considers the model as the centre of the definition. In this perspective, ML is defined mainly by the characteristics and capabilities of the model employed. This approach focuses on the technical aspects of ML, by emphasising factors such as algorithms, data processing and model performance [4].
In contrast, the second approach places the entire ML process at the centre of the definition of ML. In this form, the entire process is seen as a single entity, which includes all internal aspects/steps  such as data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and deployment. This approach acknowledges that all these stages are interconnected.
For the purposes of this page, we will be using the first definition, i.e. the model-centred approach. The reasons behind this choice mainly include the technical focus with a strong emphasis on the technical aspects of ML and the performance evaluation because it provides a clear framework for comparing against other models.
