## Introduction 

This page gives an overview of national guidelines and resources for data management planning. All data management services provided by ELIXIR-Ireland can be accessed through the [ELIXIR-Ireland website](https://elixir-ireland.ie).


## Funder guidelines and policies

Irish research funding agencies support Open Science and require data management plans (DMPs) as part of their application process. Consult the funder’s webpages for guidelines and information about research data management.
