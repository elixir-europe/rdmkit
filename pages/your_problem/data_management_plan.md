## What template should you use to draft your Data Management Plan (DMP)?

### Description

A number of DMP templates are currently available, originating from different funding agencies or institutions.
Moreover, there are ongoing efforts to develop templates for machine-actionable DMPs.

### Considerations

* Each funding agency could require or recommend a specific DMP template.
* Your institution could require and recommend a DMP template.
* Template could be presented as list of questions in text format or in a machine-actionable format.

### Solutions
* Consult the documentation of your funding agency or institution, or contact them to figure out if they require or recommend a DMP template.
* A core DMP template has been provided by [Science Europe](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/research-data/research-data-management/).
* From this [H2020 online manual](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/open-access-data-management/data-management_en.htm) you can read DMP guidelines and at the bottom of the page you can download the H2020 DMP templates in different formats.
* Consider adopting the [DMP Common Standard](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/dmp-common-standards-wg/outcomes/rda-dmp-common-standard-machine-actionable-data-management) model from the Research Data Alliance if you want to produce a machine-actionable DMP template.


## What tool should you use to write your DMP?

### Description
DMPs can be written offline by using the downloaded template in a text document format.
However, a number of web-based DMP tools are currently available that greatly facilitate the process, as they usually contain several DMP templates and provide guidance in interpreting and answering the questions.

### Considerations

* Check what DMP tool is recommended or provided by your funding agency.
* Check what DMP tool is recommended or provided by your institute.
* Make sure that the tool you choose includes the DMP template that you need.
* If you want to produce a machine-actionable DMP, you need to make sure the tool you choose allows exporting the DMP in a machine-actionable format (e.g. JSON) rather than only as a PDF document.

### Solutions
* Use the tool suggested by your funding agency or institution.
* Choose one of the following online DMP tools:
  * [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk): it is widely used in Europe and many universities or institutes provide a DMPonline instance to researchers.
  * [DMP Canvas Generator](https://dmp.vital-it.ch/): it needs an Orcid account for login.
  * [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org): it is widely used and many universities or institutes provide a DMPtool instance to researchers.
  * [Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW)](https://demo.ds-wizard.org/dashboard): it is a tool to generate machine-actionable questionnaires based on existing or new templates (knowledge models).
  * [EasyDMP](https://easydmp.no/login/): tool provided by the pan-European network EUDAT.
* Additional tools for creating a DMP are listed in the table below.


## What should you write in a DMP?

### Description
A DMP should address a broad range of data management aspects, regardless of template. It is important to be aware of the current best practices in DMPs before starting one.

### Considerations
Common topics of a DMP are:
* General information about the project.
* Description of the datasets that will be used and generated.
* Description of metadata, ontologies and data documentation.
* Storage solutions, data security and preservation strategy that will be adopted during and after the project.
* How, when and where data will be shared and published.
* Costs and resources needed for data management.
* Ethical and legal issues, such as privacy, intellectual property and licences.

### Solutions
* This website includes best practices and guidelines about the different aspects of research data management that should be covered in a DMP.
* Core requirements for DMP have been described by [Science Europe](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/research-data/research-data-management/).
* Consider the [DMP Common Standard](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/dmp-common-standards-wg/outcomes/rda-dmp-common-standard-machine-actionable-data-management) from the Research Data Alliance as a reference data model for organising the different topics.
