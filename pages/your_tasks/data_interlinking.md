## How do you interlink data for multi-omics studies across ELIXIR deposition databases?
 
### Description

Depositing (meta)data from multi-omics studies (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, imaging and complementary data types) while preserving cross-links is not straightforward but is essential. Data interlinking ensures that datasets placed in their appropriate technology- or domain-specific repositories remain connected and can be reused together. Here we provide brief recommendations to help make these links and improve the findability of related datasets across ELIXIR Deposition Databases.

### Considerations

Before starting submitting (meta)data, consider the following.

* The interlinking process is not yet fully streamlined. It varies a lot depending on the data types and repositories. You must check the repository manual for detailed information.
BioStudies is used to register biological studies and link them to related datasets stored in other EMBL-EBI databases or external repositories. It can also hold data that does not fit into any of the structured EMBL-EBI archives. For more information, see the BioStudies manual.


### Solutions <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

By using [bullet point style](style_guide#text) as much as possible, try to describe when, why and for what is best to use a specific tool or resource. 
Avoid making long list of links to tools and resources.
Make sure to add the tools and resources mentioned in the text in the main "tools and resources" table.
