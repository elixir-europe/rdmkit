## Introduction 
This page provides useful information and resources about research data management in Switzerland. Check the [overview of ELIXIR Switzerland and its services](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/switzerland).

## Governance and Funders

### SERI

The State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation ([SERI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html?_organization=1080)) within the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research EAER is the federal government’s specialised agency for national and international matters concerning education, research and innovation policy.

### SNFS

The Swiss National Science Foundation ([SNSF](https://www.snf.ch/en)) supports scientific research in all academic disciplines – from physics to medicine to sociology. At the end of 2021, the SNSF was funding 5,700 projects involving more than 20,000 researchers, which makes it the leading Swiss institution for promoting scientific research.

### Swissuniversities

[Swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en) is the common voice of the Swiss universities and promotes cooperation and coordination between the universities and the various types of universities.

### ETH Domain

The ETH Domain falls under the authority of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research (EAER). It comprises Switzerland’s two federal institutes of technology (FIT) – ETH Zurich and the EPFL in Lausanne – and four research institutes: the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL), the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag).


## National initiatives
 
[Swiss Open Research Data](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/digitalisation/open-research-data/national-strategy-and-action-plan)
In 2021, the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), the Swiss Conference of Rectors of Higher Education Institutions (swissuniversities), the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) and Switzerland’s two federal institutes of technology (ETHZ in Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne) signed an agreement to develop a national strategy on open research data.

The [Swiss ORD Strategy]( https://openresearchdata.swiss/what-is-ord/) provides a framework for the development of practices built around sharing research data in Switzerland, and for governing the services and infrastructures that support researchers and enable ORD practices. It should enable Switzerland to implement a coherent and ambitious open science policy in line with European and global developments.

[SPHN - Swiss Personalized Health Network](https://sphn.ch/)
SPHN is a national initiative under the leadership of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS). In collaboration with the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics it contributes to the development, implementation and validation of coordinated data infrastructures in order to make health-relevant data interoperable and shareable for research in Switzerland.
