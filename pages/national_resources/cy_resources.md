## Introduction 
This page provides a general overview of national resources and initiatives on research data management (RDM) in Cyprus

## Funders
H2020-WIDESPREAD-01-2018-2019: Teaming Phase 2, for €15mi for 7 years. €15mi by the Government of Cyprus and another €8mi by the  University of Cyprus. 
The Research and Innovation Foundation (RIF) is the national authority in charge of supporting and promoting research, technological development and innovation in Cyprus.

## Regulations
Cyprus National Bioethics Committee (document EEBK3). 
All medical records and biological material are kept under secure conditions at a specially prepared 
Biobank suite with absolute confidentiality and protection of sensitive data of personal character, 
in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

## Domain-specific infrastructures or resources 
Further development of the Biobank came with the success in funding by the European Commission in the framework of 
program H2020-WIDESPREAD-01-2018-2019: Teaming Phase 2, for €15mi for 7 years. 
The project is entitled: Biobanking and the Cyprus Human Genome Project. The project 
is supplemented by another €15mi by the Government of Cyprus and another €8mi by the 
University of Cyprus for a duration of 15 years, October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2034. 
It aims to upgrade the current infrastructure into a Center of Excellence in Biobanking and Biomedical Research.
