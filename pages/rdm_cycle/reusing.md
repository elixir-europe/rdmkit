## What is Data Reuse?

Data reuse means using data for other purposes than it was originally collected for. Reuse of data is particularly important in science, as it allows different researchers to analyse and publish findings based on the same data independently of one another.

Data that is well-described, curated and shared under clear terms and conditions is more likely to be reused. Integration with other data sources is also important, since that can enable new, yet unanticipated, uses for the data.

## Why is Data Reuse important?

By reusing existing data you can:

* obtain reference data for your research
* avoid doing new, unnecessary experiments
* run analyses to verify that reported findings are correct, and thereby making subsequent findings more robust
* make research more robust by aggregating results obtained from different methods or samples
* gain novel insights by connecting and meta-analysing datasets

## What should be considered for Data Reuse?

One major challenge is to find data for reuse. Another point is that you should assess the quality of the deposited data before it is reused.
One starting point can be to use value added databases with curated content. Other possibilities include searching data deposition repositories for suitable datasets based on their annotation or obtaining data directly from the author. You should keep in mind whether the repositories provide sufficient metadata to enable data reuse. Some types of data you are searching for can be straightforward to reuse (e.g. genome data) or require extensive metadata to interpret and reuse (e.g. gene expression experiment data)
The reuse of data should be aligned with the intellectual property right e.g. by making sure it is available under a suiting license.
For personal (sensitive) data all legal and technical requirements have to met before it can be accessed. Getting access to personal (sensitive) data often requires additional steps.
