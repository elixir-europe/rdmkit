## What template should I use to draft my Data Management Plan (DMP)?
 
### Description

A number of DMP templates are currently available, originating from different funding agencies or institutions.
Moreover, there are ongoing efforts to develop templates for machine-actionable DMPs.

### Considerations

* Are you submitting a grant application to a funding agency?
  * Does that agency require or recommend a specific DMP template?
* Does your institution require and recommend a DMP template?
* Would you like your DMP to be machine-actionable? 

### Solutions
* Consult the documentation of your funding agency or institution, or contact them to figure out if they require or recommend a DMP template.
  *  For European funding agencies, the list of required DMP templates is available [here](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/gm/reporting/h2020-erc-tpl-oa-data-mgt-plan_en.odt).
* Consider adopting the [DMP Common Standard](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/dmp-common-standards-wg/outcomes/rda-dmp-common-standard-machine-actionable-data-management) model from the Research Data Alliance if you want to produce a machine-actionable DMP.


## What tool should I use to write my DMP?
 
### Description
DMPs can be written offline by using the downloaded template in a text document format.
However, we a number of web-based DMP tools are currently available and greatly facilitate the process, as they usually contain several DMP templates and provide guidance in interpreting and answering the questions.

### Considerations

* Does your funding agency recommend or provide a specific DMP tool?
* Does your institution recommend or provide a specific DMP tool?
* Do you need to use a specific DMP template?
  * If so, you need to make sure the tool you choose includes that template.
* Do you want to produce a machine-actionable DMP?
  * If so, you need to make sure the tool you choose allows exporting the DMP in a machine-actionable format (e.g. JSON) rather than only as a PDF document.

### Solutions
* Use the tool suggested by your funding agency or institution.
* Choose one of the following online DMP tools:
  * [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)
  * [DMP Canvas Generator](https://dmp.vital-it.ch/) (Needs an Orcid account to login)
  * [DMPT](https://dmptool.org)
  * [DMPlanner](https://dmplanner.athenarc.gr)
  * [Argos](https://argos.openaire.eu/splash/)
  * [DMP OPIDoR](https://dmp.opidor.fr)
  * [Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW)](https://demo.ds-wizard.org/dashboard) 
  * [EasyDMP](https://easydmp.no/login/)

## What should I write in a DMP?

### Description
A DMP should address a broad range of data management aspects, regardless of template. It is important to be aware of the current best practices in DMPs before starting one.

#### Solutions
* This toolkit includes best practices and guidelines about different aspects of research data management that should be contemplated in a Data Management plan:
  * Find and reuse existing data: [Collecting](collecting), [Re-using](re-using).
  * File format
  * Data volume
  * Data sharing
  * Licences
  * Metadata: [Metadata Management](metadata_management)
  * Ontology
  * Data documentation
  * Data organisation
  * Identifiers
  * Data quality
  * Storage
  * Security
  * Costs for data management, storage and sharing
  * Responsibilities
  * Ethical and legal issues
* Consider the [DMP Common Standard](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/dmp-common-standards-wg/outcomes/rda-dmp-common-standard-machine-actionable-data-management) from the Research Data Alliance as a reference data model for organizing these topic.
