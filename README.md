# RDMkit
The ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit

RDMkit is an online guide containing good data management practices applicable to research projects from the beginning to the end. Developed and managed by people who work every day with life science data, RDMkit has guidelines, information and pointers, organised in many different ways to help you with problems throughout the data’s life cycle.

You will find helpful advice for where you are in the data’s life cycle (from collection planning to archiving) and for what kind of data problem you may have. Our up to date tools and resources lists are smartly cross-linked to these guidelines.  We also have tailored help for different areas of biology and their specialist data types, and real examples of how tools have been assembled to support data management.  

Our goal is to make data management easier for you, and to help you make your data FAIR  - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

## RDMkit is an ELIXIR product

ELIXIR is an intergovernmental organisation that brings together life science resources from across Europe. These resources include databases, software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers. All the ELIXIR National nodes and the special EMBL-EBI node have come to support data management within the Nodes and for data stewards, researchers and institutional data managers. The idea is to support data management at the point of creation and enable data to be "FAIR by Design". The development of a Research Data Management Kit will provide researchers with a strategy to manage their data to international standards.
