To carry out RDM tasks FAIRly and effectively, it is important to consider not only common global solutions but also existing, national solutions, that are often dependent on institute- and country-specific policies, funders, and infrastructures.

Here, we point to non-exhaustive collection of country-specific information resources such as local funding agencies and research councils, and information on local policies for open science, national regulations on data ethics, and domain-specific infrastructures and tools.

These country-specific RDM overviews will help readers to seek national advice and could be an inspirational guide for other countries to implement and promote data management practices at national level.
