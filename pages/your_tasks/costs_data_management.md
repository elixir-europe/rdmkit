## How to estimate the costs of data management?

### Description

The processes of data management will incur costs. The expenses may consist of people’s time, tools and services needed for managing the research data during the whole life cycle of the project. You should estimate these costs and address the resources needed in your data management plan. 

### Considerations 

* Budgeting and costing for your data management is often dependent upon local and temporal circumstances, institutional resources, services, and policies. You have to take into account even items such as investments (site services, infrastructure), operations (network, electricity, maintenance) and personnel costs. 
* Note that there may be costs of data even beyond the end of the project. 
* Planning and implementing data management well can save you from arising costs later on during your research project! 
* The bigger your project (or e.g. infrastructure) is or the more partners are involved, it is useful to consider the measures needed to implement and operationalise data management. For example would you need a dedicated data manager, should roles and responsibilities about various data management activities be allocated, do you need training, other resources or extra time? All of these aspects are important to be taken into consideration when addressing data management costs. 

### Solutions 
* To get an overview of possible costs in your research project, you can go through different research [life cycle phases](data_life_cycle) and activities specific for your project.
* Some organisations have prepared costing tools to help formulate and budget data management costs. Tools such as the [Data Management costing Tool](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/plan-to-share/costing/) developed by the UK Data Service or the [TU Delft data management costing tool](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/plan/data-management-costs) help to budget for personnel costs or for the additional costs that are needed to preserve and share research data beyond your research project.

#### Costs for Data Stewards
* Personal costs of Data Steward as an eligible cost in many projects. (FTE limitation)
* Which data management tasks will be carried out by a data steward, how many person months will be needed?

#### Costs for data collection 
* Collecting and reusing data: Do you need specific equipment or services for data collection or if you reuse data from a data repository will it be free?
* Granularity of data: Will you need all the data you can collect or is less enough to answer your research question? The more data you have, the more expensive it gets to store, clean and transfer the data. 
* Organising and formatting data: Up-to-date data catalogue/registry of data provenance, beforehand planned and clear file structure and templates will lower the involved costs and time spent for data organisation.

#### Costs for data processing and data documentation
* Anonymisation: Costs for anonymisation of data for controlled or public release.
* Digitisation: Do you have paper-based or analogue data that needs to be digitised? Will you need equipment or software for this or does it require manual checking? If yes, remember to budget for both equipment as well as for time consumed. 
* Data documentation: To make your data understandable, you need to document how it has been used and what it means. You need to describe the context, methodology, creation process, what the variables & abbreviations mean as well how the data was processed and quality controlled. The better this has been done during the project the less time you will need for this at the end of the project.
* Data cleaning: Does your data need to be cleaned, verified, checked or do you for example combine different data sets? Have you made good documentation documents about what have done, what the variables means, do you have readme-files explaining your files? Data cleaning takes time and the better you have organised your data while collecting & processing it, the less you will need time at the end of the project when sharing the data. 
* Describing data & metadata: Consider how much work is needed to provide the necessary metadata and fill in metadata fields?

#### Costs for data storing, access control and security measures
* Data storage & back up: Consider costs for active data storage during the lifetime of the project, as well as archive beyond the end of the study.
* Access & security: What kind of access control and security measures does your data need to be protected against unauthorised use? Do you need special protected servers or services such as encryption or software during your research project? These might cause additional costs.


#### Costs for making data available (publishing/sharing) and preserving
* Data sharing: Where do you plan to share and/ or preserve your data and are there some direct costs that the service provider charges, e.g. per € per GB /year? Remember to take into consideration that cleaning the data to a format that it can be shared as well as discovery metadata creation will take time.
* Consent for data sharing: Establish a point of contact for data access where access is controlled and consider costs for administering this.
* File formats: Do you need to convert your data to a different (open or standard) format for sharing or preserving data and do you need additional software or hardware for this? In addition to time, software might cause costs.
