## Keywords
Research, operational, supporting. Interacts primarily with researchers.

## Description
As a research data steward, I support and work in close collaboration with the main data producers and users in academia: the researchers, ranging from undergraduate students to full professors. I advise researchers, make sure data is handled in a manner compliant with the institute’s policy and may also perform hands-on work in a project. 

My work focuses on implementing the institute’s data guidelines and translating them into domain and project specific procedures, for example by managing a database or reviewing data management plans. My responsibilities and tasks focus on translating the researcher  needs on data into infrastructural and service requirements.

## Focus
* Develop and implement data management plans for projects and data collections and align Data Managements Plans (DMP) with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and the principles of Open Science
* Advise projects and data collections on compliance with codes of conduct, regulations and field specific legal and ethical standards
* Provide adequate research data management (RDM) support to researchers. This involves, for example, supporting researchers in improving the reproducibility of their computational analyses or directing researchers to appropriate data management and archival solutions
* Monitor a project’s needs regarding data-infrastructure and tools for RDM
* Determine the adequate level of knowledge and skills of researchers on RDM
* Identify the requirements of adequate support and data infrastructure for FAIR and long-term archiving of data of a project

## Learning path
Institutes across Europe have started hiring professional data stewards. A research oriented data steward is expected to be competent in the following areas:
* Create awareness and communicate about RDM and the FAIR data principles and translate RDM policies into guidelines for researchers
* Transform discipline specific research data into FAIR data with help of available services and tools
* Advise and assist researchers on short and long term actions for RDM
* Assess RDM knowledge and skills, identify gaps among researchers and take action when needed
* Understand the purpose and use of a DMP in a project and have the skills to utilise the available tools and templates to produce a DMP 
* Assist researchers in developing a DMP, review DMPs, and support researchers in putting DMPs into action
* Liaise with the surrounding environment (department, project, national stakeholders and international network) and continuously follow the field to gain knowledge of relevant facilities, tools and emerging standards available for RDM
