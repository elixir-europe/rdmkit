## What is Galaxy?

Galaxy is a well-known **open-source platform for FAIR data analysis** that enables users to:
- **access and collect data** from reference databases, external repositories and other data sources;
- **use tools from various domains** that can be plugged into workflows through its graphical web interface;
- **run code in interactive environments** (RStudio, Jupyter...) along with other tools or workflows;
- **manage data** by sharing and publishing results, workflows, and visualizations;
- **capture the metadata** of data analyses, thus ensuring their reproducibility.

Galaxy supports scientists to perform accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational analysis. The Galaxy Community is actively involved in helping the ecosystem improve and sharing scientific discoveries.


### Who can use Galaxy?

Galaxy also provides [open infrastructure ready to use for researchers worldwide](https://galaxyproject.org/use/). All what you need is a web browser and an account in a public server:
- [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu/)
- [US Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.org/)
- [Australian Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.org.au/)

## What can you use Galaxy for?

Galaxy can be used at different stages of the data life cycle, covering from the data collection to the reuse steps.
