## Can you really deposit your data in a public repository?

### Description
Sometimes it is difficult to determine if publishing data you have at hand is the right thing to do. Some reasons for hesitations might be that you have not used the data in a publication yet and don't want to be scooped, that the data contains personal information about patients or that the data was collected or produced in a collaboration.

### Considerations
* Publishing data does not necessarily mean open access nor public. Data can be published with closed or restricted access.
* Data doesn't have to be published immidiately while you are still working on the project. Data can be made available during the revision of the paper or after the publication of the paper.
* Make sure to have the rights or permissions to publish the data.
  * Is the data commercially-sensitive?
  * Does the data contain confidential/restricted information?
  * Who controls the data?

### Solutions
* If ethical, legal or contractual issues apply to your data (e.g. personal or sensitive data, confidential or third-party data, data with copyright, data with potential economic or commercial value, intellectual property or IP data, etc) ask help to the Legal Team, Tech Transfer Office or Data Protection Officer of your institute.
* Decide what is the right [type of access](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/sharing#what-should-be-considered-for-data-sharing) for your data, for instance:
  * Open access.
  * Registered access or with authentication procedure.
  * Controlled access or via Data Access Committees (DACs).
* Decide what [licence](licensing) should be applied to your metadata and data.
* Certain repositories offer solutions for depositing data that need to be under restricted access. This allows for data to be findable even when it can not be published openly. One example is the [The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/) that can be used to deposit potentially identifiable genetic and phenotypic human data.
* Many repositories provide the option to put an embargo on a deposited dataset. This might be useful if you prefer to use the data in a publication before making it available for others to use.
* Establish an agreement outlining the controllership of the data and each collaborators' rights and responsibilities.
* Even if the data cannot be published, it is good practice to publish the metadata of your datasets.

## Which repository should you use to publish your data?

### Description
Once you have completed your experiments and have performed quality control of your data it is good scientific practice to share your data in a public repository. Publishing your data is often required by funders and publishers.

The most suitable repository will depend on the data type and your discipline.

### Considerations
  * What type of data are you planning to publish?
  * Does the repository need to provide solutions for restricted access for sensitive data?
  * Do you have the rights to publish the data via the repository?
  * How sustainable is the repository, will the data remain public over time?
  * How FAIR is the repository?
  * Does the funding agency or the scientific journal pose specific requirements regarding data sharing?
  * What are the repository's policies concerning licences and data reuse?


### Solutions
* Based on the possible ethical, legal and contractual implications of your data, decides:
  * The right [type of access](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/sharing#what-should-be-considered-for-data-sharing) for your data.
  * The [licence](licensing) that should be applied to your metadata and data.
* Check if/what discipline-specific repositories can apply the necessary access conditions and licences to your (meta)data.
* Discipline-specific repositories: if a discipline-specific repository, recognised by the community, exists this should be your first choice since discipline-specific repositories often increases the FAIRness of the data.
  * The [EMBL-EBI's data submission wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) will help you choose a suitable repository based on your data type.
  * Lists of discipline-specific, community-recognised repositories can be found in the following links:
    * [ELIXIR Deposition Databases](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases).
    * [Scientific Data journal's recommended repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories).
* General-purpose and institutional repositories: For other cases, a repository that accepts data of different types and disciplines should be considered. It could be a [general-purpose repository](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#general) or a centralised repository provided by your institution or university.
* [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org) or [Repository Finder](https://repositoryfinder.datacite.org) gathers information about existing repositories and allows you to filter them based on access and licence types.
* [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org) and [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org) websites gather features of repositories, which you can filter by discipline, data type, taxonomy and many other features.

## How do you prepare your data for publication in data repositories?

### Description
Once you have decided where to publish your data, you will have to make your (meta)data ready for repository submission. For this reason it is recommended to become aware of repository's requirements before start collecting the data.

### Considerations
  * What file formats should be used for the data?
  * How is the data uploaded?
  * What metadata do you need to provide?
  * Under which licence should the data be published?


### Solutions
  * Learn the following information about the chosen repositories:
    * Required metadata schemes.
    * Required ontologies or controlled vocabularies.
    * Accepted file formats for data and metadata.
    * Costs for sharing and storing data.
  * Repositories generally have information about data formats, metadata requirements and how data can be uploaded under a section called "submit", "submit data", "for submitters" or something similar. Read this section in detail.
  * To ascertain re-usability data should be released with a clear and accessible data usage [licence](licensing). We suggest making your data available under licences that permit free reuse of data, e.g. a Creative Commons licence, such as CC0 or CC-BY. 
    * Note that every repository can have one default licence for all datasets. For instance, sequence data submitted to for example [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) are implicitly free to reuse by others as specified in the [INCD Standards and policies](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/about/policies).
  * See the corresponding page for more detailed information about [metadata](metadata_management), [licences](licensing) and [data transfer](data_transfer).
