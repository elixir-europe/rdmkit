We appreciate people have different preferences and abilities when using websites. We have tried to make the site easy to use and understand, no matter what technology or browsing method you are using. For example, you should be able to:

  * change colours, contrast levels and fonts
  * zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
  * navigate the website using just a keyboard
  * listen to most of the website using a screen reader.

We aim to conform to the to the 'AA' standard of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). This is not just a legal requirement in the European Union, but a best practice that will enable as many people as possible to use the site.

## How to report problems
If you have any difficulties or annoyances using the site, or feel that we are not meeting accessibility requirements, then please contact us ([rdm-editors@elixir-europe.org](mailto:rdm-editors@elixir-europe.org)). We will do our best to make the site easier to use.

## How we assess the accessibility of the site
The website is a community effort, so unfortunately we do not have the resources to hire an accessibility expert. However, our community includes professional web developers, who assess the accessibility of the site using:

  * [The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative checklist](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
  * [The British government accessibility checklist](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one/doing-a-basic-accessibility-check-if-you-cant-do-a-detailed-one)
  * [The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
  * [AccessibilityTest.org](https://accessibilitytest.org), which runs several online accessibility checkers at once.

The website was last tested on 17 May 2021.

## Level of compliance
As far as we can ascertain, this website is compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. If you feel there are issues to address, however, then please email [rdm-editors@elixir-europe.org](mailto:rdm-editors@elixir-europe.org).
