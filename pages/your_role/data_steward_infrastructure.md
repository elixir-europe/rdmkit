## Description
As a infrastructure data steward, I focus on liaising with the people involved in the IT infrastructure, technicians, application managers and other service providers inside and outside my research  institute. My task is to translate the requirements of policies and science into suitable IT solutions and tools as well as provide advice. I implement IT infrastructure solutions, give access to data and software, and I may also perform hands-on work in a research project.

## Focus
* Identify the requirements of an adequate data infrastructure and tool landscape that fits with research data management (RDM) policies
* Ensure the compliance of the data infrastructure and tool landscape with codes of conduct and regulations
* Align the data infrastructure and tool landscape to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and the principles of Open Science, and facilitate and support FAIR data
* Identify the requirements of and provide access to data infrastructure for RDM for researchers
* Make an inventory for data infrastructure and tools that fit with the researchers RDM needs
* Liaison and align the data infrastructure and tools management in and outside the organisation
* Facilitate the availability of local data-infrastructure and tools for FAIR and long term archiving of data

## Learning path
Institutes across Europe have started hiring professional data stewards. A infrastructure oriented data steward is expected to be competent in the following areas:
* Advise and assist researchers on short and long term actions for data infrastructure and tools
* Continuously monitor data infrastructure and tools available inside and outside the institute, in close collaboration with the responsible (IT) department
* Assess technical knowledge status of researchers and relevant stakeholders (including other data stewards), and if needed give training in technical RDM skills
* Communicate with researchers, technical staff and support staff about data infrastructure and tools
* Knowledge of encryption of data, data protection and data security protocols
* Translate ethical and technical requirements for data infrastructure and tools to technological measures, while understanding the research requirements and limitations
* Translate the FAIR data principles into data infrastructure and tool requirements
* Advise researchers and stakeholders (including other data stewards) on archiving solutions, including (meta)data standards
