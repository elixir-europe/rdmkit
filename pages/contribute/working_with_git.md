## Forking - branching - changing - pushing - PR

This is a general workflow in how to work on your own fork (copy) of the rdmkit repo and request changes through a pull request:
NOTE: if you already did these steps in the past, start from the `git fetch upstream` command. 

- Make a fork of this repository, using the fork button.
- Open a terminal and clone your fork using:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/rdmkit.git
    cd rdmkit
    ```
    NOTE: Make sure you clone the fork and not the original elixir-europe/rdmkit one.
- Keep your fork up to date (IMPORTANT!).
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdmkit.git
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout master (if you are not already on the master branch, check with `git branch`)
    git pull upstream master
    ```
- Create a new branch named after your feature/edit.
    ```
    git checkout -b 'FEATURE_NAME'
    ```
- Make the changes you want to make using an editor of choice
- Save.
- Open terminal and stage your changes:
    ```
    git add .
    ```
- Committing changes
    ```
    git commit -m "Changing the tool-resource file"
    ```
- Pushing you changes to your fork
    ```
    git push origin 'FEATURE_NAME'
    ```
- Go to [https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdmkit](https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdmkit) and click on *Compare & pull request*
- Open the pull request an describe your changes.
- Wait for review by other editors. Editors that are responsible for the sections you make changes to will be assigned as reviewer automatically.

## The advantage of working locally: previewing your changes through your web browser

The website is build on GitHub using Jekyll, a simple, static site generator based on ruby. When you have a local copy cloned onto your computer, it is possible to generate the website based on this repo. This makes it possible to preview changes live, every time you save a file from within the GitHub rdmkit repo. Follow these steps to deploy the website based on your local clone (copy) of the rdmkit repo:

1. Make sure you have cloned the rdmkit repo
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/rdmkit.git
    cd rdmkit
    ```

2. If not already present on your machine, install ruby. Note that incompatibility issues may arise with ruby 3.0.0 (released 25.12.20) or newer versions.


3. Install Jekyll
If youâ€™ve never installed or run a Jekyll site locally on your computer, follow these instructions to install Jekyll:
   * Install Jekyll on MacOS/Ubuntu/Other_Linux/Windows: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

4. Install Bundler and Jekyll

    ```
    gem install jekyll bundler
    ```

5. Install dependencies

    ```
    bundle install
    ```

6. deploy website

    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```
