## Introduction
Virology is a rapidly evolving field that generates diverse and complex datasets, from genomic sequences to clinical trial results and epidemiological data. Effective research data management (RDM) is essential to ensure that these valuable datasets are organized, shared, and preserved in a manner that enables long-term impact.

## Data Heterogeneity
 
### Description
Outbreak surveillance in virology requires the integration of multiple data types, including sequencing, clinical, and epidemiological data. These data types originate from diverse sources, such as hospitals, research laboratories, and public health agencies, making their harmonization and interoperability critical. Without standardized data management approaches, inconsistencies in metadata, sampling protocols, and data formats can hinder effective outbreak response, cross-study comparisons, and reproducibility of findings.

### Considerations
Key challenges in managing data heterogeneity include:
* Standardizing sample collection protocols across clinical and environmental settings to ensure comparability.
* Adopting structured, appropriate and sufficient  metadata to improve data annotation and organization .
* Integrating epidemiological and genomic data to enhance outbreak detection and integrative and global responses.

### Solutions
To effectively manage data heterogeneity in virology outbreak surveillance, several domain-specific solutions are recommended:
* The ['Data Provenance' page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_provenance) on RDMkit provides comprehensive guidance on capturing metadata, documenting data origins, and maintaining transparent records, ensuring data traceability and reproducibility.
* Use standardized protocols for sample collection by identifying and reviewing existing guidelines from organizations such as WHO, CDC, and ISO standards to ensure alignment with best practices.

  * The ['Documentation and metadata' page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/metadata_management) on RDMkit offers practical recommendations and standards for accurately describing data, ensuring consistent interpretation, interoperability, and long-term usability.
  * Apply {% tool "mixs" %} and the complementary [MIUVIG (Minimum Information about Uncultivated Virus Genomes)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4306) for annotating viral sequence data with necessary metadata fields.
  * Adapt generic dataset descriptions (e.g. DCAT, Dublin core, (bio)schema.org) for basic dataset descriptions.
  * Follow {% tool "biosamples" %} Metadata Schema from EBI for structured viral sample metadata.
* Ensure metadata compliance with international repositories
  * The ['Data Brokering' page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_brokering) on RDMkit describes strategies and tools for integrating, harmonizing, and translating data across diverse formats and sources.
  * Format metadata to meet the submission requirements of repositories like {% tool "gisaid" %} and {% tool "european-nucleotide-archive" %} to ensure smooth data deposition and retrieval.
  * Utilize validation tools and checklists to ensure completeness and accuracy before data submission.
* FAIRsharing resources for metadata selection
  * Refer to the [EVORA collection](https://fairsharing.org/5449) of FAIRsharing-referenced metadata standards for pandemic preparedness and response.
  * Consult {% tool "fairsharing" %} registries to identify suitable standards for different types of virology datasets.
  * Integrate epidemiological and genomic data for outbreak analysis, by utilizing phylodynamic workflows (e.g., BEAST, Nextstrain, or TreeTime), enabling real-time outbreak tracking.
  * Implement structured pipelines for linking viral genome sequences with patient and outbreak metadata.
* Apply domain-specific vocabularies for consistent annotation
  * Utilize the [EVORA ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/evorao) and [ICTV ontologies](https://ictv.global/taxonomy) to ensure that virus-related metadata terms are standardized and interoperable.
  * Monitor updates in virology-specific ontologies to maintain alignment with evolving standards.
By implementing these best practices, outbreak surveillance data can be better structured, more interoperable, and more effectively shared, ultimately improving global response efforts to viral outbreaks.

## Data Sensitivity & Ethics
 
### Description
Handling sensitive data in virology outbreak surveillance involves managing patient data, ensuring proper anonymization, and complying with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The ethical and legal aspects of handling such data are crucial to maintaining patient privacy while allowing researchers and public health authorities to analyze and respond to viral threats effectively.
Proper data governance strategies must balance the need for data accessibility and data security, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access identifiable information. Secure storage, controlled access mechanisms, and appropriate anonymization techniques must be implemented to meet legal and ethical standards.

### Considerations
Key challenges in managing data sensitivity and ethics include:
* Ensuring compliance with GDPR and other legal frameworks when collecting, processing, and sharing sensitive patient data.
* Anonymizing and pseudonymizing patient data to reduce privacy risks while preserving data utility for research.
* Implementing secure and scalable storage solutions that support controlled data access, encryption, and long-term preservation.

### Solutions
Organizations must implement robust governance policies, encryption techniques, and controlled data access mechanisms to maintain patient privacy while enabling scientific advancements. The following strategies outline best practices for secure data management and ethical compliance.
* Ensure GDPR and regulatory compliance
  * For guidance on managing sensitive data ethically and in compliance with regulations, the RDMkit pages on '[GDPR compliance](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/gdpr_compliance)', '[Ethical aspects](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/ethics)', and '[Compliance monitoring & measurement](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/compliance_monitoring)' provide detailed recommendations on protecting personal data, navigating ethical responsibilities, and implementing effective compliance monitoring practices.
  * Identify and mitigate privacy risks associated with human and health-related data (see RDMkit [Human data](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/human_data) and [Health data](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/health_data) domain pages).
  * Establish clear data governance policies defining roles and responsibilities regarding data processing and sharing.
  * Ensure contractual coverage for data exchanges through appropriate agreements (e.g., Data Use Agreements, Consortium Agreements, Data Sharing Agreements), explicitly outlining data usage, retention, reuse, and publication policies. Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) should similarly address the handling of human data derived from received samples.
