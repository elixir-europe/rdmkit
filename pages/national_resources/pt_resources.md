## Introduction 
This page provides an overview of data management resources in Portugal, with a particular focus on the life and health sciences research communities, and research data management resources and services provided by [BioData.pt | ELIXIR Portugal](https://biodata.pt).

## Funders

### Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia

The Foundation for Science and Technology ([_Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia_, FCT](https://www.fct.pt)) is the national public agency
providing support for research for science, innovation, and technology in all domains. It is a public institute of special resposibility under
the tutelage and superintendence of the Ministry of Education, Science and Innovation.
FCT provides their own [Data Management Plan template (in Portuguese)](https://polen.fccn.pt/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Modelo-PGD-FCT.pdf).

## National Infrastructures and Resources

### Fundação para a Computação Científica Nacional

The Foundation for National Scientific Computing ([_Fundação para a Computação Científica Nacional_, FCCN](https://www.fccn.pt)) is the Scientific
Computing Unit of FCT. FCCN provides high-speed Internet connectivity and IT services to the Portuguese higher education and research system.

#### National Network for Advanced Computing

The [RNCA - National Network for Advanced Computing](https://rnca.fccn.pt) - is managed by FCCN, with the aim of making advanced computing services available to the research, technology and innovation communities. RCNA's network of operational centres include the EuroHPC [Deucalion supercomputer](https://macc.fccn.pt/resources#deucalion). It is a member of the Iberian Advanced Computing Network, with also includes the [MareNostrum](https://www.bsc.es/marenostrum/marenostrum) supercomputers in Spain.

#### POLEN

[POLEN](https://polen.fccn.pt) is a project developed by FCCN which aims to address the needs of the scientific and education communities in
research data management. It also aims to promote open science, and the sharing and preservation of research data generated within the scope of
projects developed with public funding.

### Fórum GDI

The Research Data Management Forum ([Fórum de Gestão de Dados de Informação](https://forumgdi.rcaap.pt)) is a space for the debate and sharing of
ideas, projects, and best practices in Research Data Management, aiming to join together RDM support professionals in research institutions and
science funding organisations.

### National Distributed Computing Infrastructure

The [National Distributed Computing Infrastructure (INCD)](https://www.incd.pt) provides computing and data services to the national scientific and academic community in all areas of knowledge. The infrastructure is especially oriented to provide scientific computing services, supporting researchers and the participation in national and international projects.

## Life and Health Sciences Infrastructures and Resources

### BioData.pt

[BioData.pt](https://biodata.pt) is the national research infrastructure for life and health data, and the host of ELIXIR Portugal. BioData.pt is a registered
nonprofit association of several major Portuguese universities and research institutes acting in the life and health sciences. It is integrated in the [National Roadmap of Research Infrastructures of Strategic Interest (RNIE)](https://www.fct.pt/en/financiamento/programas-de-financiamento/infraestruturas-de-investigacao/).

BioData.pt, through its affiliate institutions, provides a wide array of RDM tools, databases, and training programmes tailored towards the Life and Health Sciences communities, which are aggregated in its [Services page](https://biodata.pt/services).

## Institutional policies on research data in Portugal

Some institutions implemented their own data management policies. Here are few examples from the organisations in Life and Health Sciences:
* [Centre of Marine Sciences (CCMAR)](https://ccmar.ualg.pt/en/our-policies)
* [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)](https://zenodo.org/record/6325980#.YmrF1m7MJTY)
* [NOVA Institute of Medical Systems Biology (NIMSB)](https://nimsb.unl.pt/research-innovation/data-management-plan/)


## Finding more

Portugal has a large number of Research Data Management and Open Data initiatives at the national, local, and institutional level. Initiatives such as [INDEXAR](https://www.indexar.pt) and [dados.gov.pt](https://dados.gov.pt) aggregate existing resources to facilitate locating the right one for the user's needs.
