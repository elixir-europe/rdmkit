To be able to effectively develop and use data management solutions at global level, it is important to take into account national solutions that could help address certain data management tasks. We compile here a list of national (country-specific) resources such as local funding agencies and research councils, and information on local policies for open science, national regulations on data ethics, domain-specific infrastructures, and so on. We believe these collections could be an inspirational guide for other countries to create a catalogue on what can help with implementing and promoting data management practices at national level.
