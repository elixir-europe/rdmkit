## Introduction

This page provides an overview of the data management resources in Norway. The target audience is the Norwegian scientific community in the life sciences and collaborators.
The [Data Stewardship Wizard instance from ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir-no.ds-wizard.org/knowledge-models/elixir.no:lifesciences-elixir-norway:latest/preview) provides an interactive way to navigate these recommendations and resources.

<!---General RDM considerations for your country, how to deal with RDM on a national level--->
The Norwegian government has released a
[National strategy on access to and sharing of research data](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/national-strategy-on-access-to-and-sharing-of-research-data/id2582412/?ch=1) in 2018.

##  Funder policies on research data

List of funders with Data Management Policies in Norway:

* [Norges Forskningsråd (Research Council of Norway)](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/) is the primary funding body in Norway for research. The [research data management policy of RCN](https://www.forskningsradet.no/contentassets/e4cd6d2c23cf49d4989bb10c5eea087a/the-research-council-of-norways-policy-for-open-access-to-research-data.pdf) requires a Data Management Plan (DMP) after a positive funding decision for each project and which also has to be submitted as part of a final report. RCN recommends to follow the ‘[Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management](https://scienceeurope.org/our-resources/practical-guide-to-the-international-alignment-of-research-data-management/)’ by Science Europe, the organisation of research funders and  performers. In addition to policies for open science and open access to publications, [RCN provides recommendations on how to make research data available](https://www.forskningsradet.no/siteassets/publikasjoner/2021/how-should-we-share-research-data.v2.pdf). 


##  Institutional policies on research data

### Institutional storage guidelines

Most universities in Norway classify data into four categories, depending on access requirements:
* Open (Green)
* Restricted (Yellow)
* Confidential (Red)
* Strictly confidential (Black)

Details and provided solutions vary according to each institution. They are based on the recommendations from [UNIT](https://www.unit.no/klassifisering-av-informasjon-og-informasjonssikkerhet).

    * [SIOS Svalbard](https://sios-svalbard.org/Documents#docSDMS)

* [NRIS technical and administrative support](https://www.sigma2.no/user-support)

## Data Management Planning
A data management plan (DMP) is currently requested by:
* The research performing institutions 
* RCN upon project funding
* International funding programs (e.g. Horizon Europe, European Research Council)

A DMP typically contains information about data handling during a project and after its completion and makes it possible to identify (and budget for) significant issues to be resolved (e.g. storage). While some of the institutions mentioned above require DMPs to follow a certain standard, this does not apply to all local institutions (e.g. [UiO does not currently enforce any specific template](https://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data-management-old/data-management-plan/)). There are several tools available for creating a DMP. 

<!-- Some of these tools come from international providers (e.g. DMPonline), some are national services, such as EasyDMP (Sigma2) and sikt’s DMP tool. -->

ELIXIR Norway provides access to a [national instance of the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW)](elixir-no.ds-wizard.org/). This is an internationally developed tool which has been adapted to better suit the needs of Norwegian researchers, PIs and institutions. DSW provides templates that are compliant  with all different funders' regulations, is [recommened by RCN](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Adviser-research-policy/open-science/open-access-to-research-data/) and, in addition, it offers machine-actionable DMP exports. To facilitate the adoption of best-practises, the ELIXIR-NO DSW instance also provides a collection of exemplar DMPs; these DMPs are partially pre-filled with domain-specific recommendations and can be used as a starting point for own projects.
