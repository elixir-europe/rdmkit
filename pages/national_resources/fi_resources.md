## Introduction 

This is an overview of research data management resources in Finland. These resources are accessible for researchers in Finland and to their collaborators.

[CSC – IT Center for Science](https://research.csc.fi/home) provides comprehensive scientific computing, data management and analysis services and solutions for research in Finland. CSC operates the ELIXIR Finland node and offers medical and bioinformatic research tools developed in Finland and Europe. An overview of data management services provided by ELIXIR Finland and CSC can be found on the [ELIXIR Finland](https://www.elixir-finland.org/en/frontpage/) website and [CSC's Services for Research](https://research.csc.fi/home) website.

## Regulations and policies on research data

Every research data involves the questions of rights, legal and ethical issues. Contact you own organisation's data management support services for guidance on ethical and legal compliance and data protection and ownership. 

If personal data are processed in your research, [Data Protection Act](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2018/20181050) will apply to it. [Data Protection Ombudsman](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/home) is a national supervisory authority which supervises the compliance with data protection legislation. 

Ethical review is needed in defined research configurations. See more at [Finnish National Board of Research Integrity](https://tenk.fi/en/ethical-review/ethical-review-finland).

### National policies
[Policies of open science and research in Finland](https://avointiede.fi/en/policies/policies-open-science-and-research-finland) outline in detail the strategic principles, objectives and action plans necessary to achieve the objectives set out in [the Declaration for Open Science and Research](https://avointiede.fi/en/policies/declaration-open-science-and-research-2020-2025). The policies cover four areas: culture for open scholarship, open access to scholarly publications, open access of research data and methods, and open education and open access to educational resources. 

### Funder policies 
Funders have their individual data policies and mandatory guidelines with regard to research data management. The general expectation is that publicly funded research data are a public good, and should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. Check your funder’s website for current information and guidance. See e.g. [Academy of Finland policies on open science](https://www.aka.fi/en/research-funding/responsible-science/open-science/academy-policies-on-open-science/).

### Institutional policies
Universities and other research organisations and data service providers have data policies describing the principles and policies that are related to the management of research data [(e.g CSC Data Policy)](https://www.csc.fi/en/data-policy). In addition, data policies make clear the responsibilities of the organisation and its researchers for managing research data well. Remember to check your organisation's current information and guidance.

## Domain-specific resources

Finland has a long tradition of collecting and analysing biobank samples and the associated clinical data. Read more about domain specific resources from [ELIXIR-FI webpages](https://www.elixir-finland.org/en/data-resources/).

National social and health data resources can be searched in [Aineistokatalogi](https://aineistokatalogi.fi/catalog/studies), a catalogue developed in cooperation between The Finnish institute for health and welfare (THL), Statistics Finland, the Data Archives and Sitra.
