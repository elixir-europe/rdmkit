## Introduction 
This is an overview of research data management resources in the Netherlands, relevant for researchers in the Netherlands and to their collaborators. 

The [ELIXIR Netherlands website](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/netherlands) provides information on the organisation of and resources for ELIXIR Netherlands partners. The Dutch ELIXIR Node is hosted by the [Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL)](https://www.dtls.nl), a public-private partnership of more than 50 life science institutions, and focuses on data stewardship capacity building, services and infrastructure to support FAIR implementation for the Dutch life science research. 

## Funders
National funders [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-data-management) and [ZonMw](https://www.zonmw.nl/en/research-and-results/fair-data-and-data-management) consider responsible research data management an essential component of good research practice. They promote FAIR data stewardship - among others via mandatory data management plans, the requirement to deposit and share (meta)data, and facilitating researchers in creating FAIR data, with help of the [GO FAIR Foundation](https://www.gofairfoundation.org/), Health-RI and DTL. For information on the requirements for FAIR data stewardship, visit the funders’ webpages and consult their particular policies on data management and Open Science.

## National initiatives
Together with [Health-RI](https://www.health-ri.nl), DTL is leading the national roadmap for the [Thematic Digital Competence Center (TDCC)](https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/implementation-plan-investments-digital-research-infrastructure/roadmaps-three) for Life Science & Health (LSH), funded by NWO. The TDCC LSH network was established in the spring of 2022, and is contributing to strengthening and harmonising the digital practises among stakeholders in the broad Dutch research domains of life sciences and biomedical/health sciences. The TDCC-LSH is collaborating cross-domain with Social Sciences and Humanities (TDCC-SSH) and Natural and Engineering Sciences (TDCC-NES). 

Moreover, DTL also coordinates the National Programme Open Science (NPOS) [FAIR Data Programme Line](https://www.openscience.nl/en/npos-2/), and has delivered the reports [Towards FAIR data steward as profession for the lifesciences](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3471707) and [Professionalising data stewardship in the Netherlands](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4320504), including the [NPOS/ELIXIR Data Stewardship Competency Framework](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/training/).

The following national services provide useful information and support:
* [The National Coordination Point Research Data Management](https://www.lcrdm.nl/en) (LCRDM)
* [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en), the collaborative organisation for IT in Dutch education and research
* [DANS](https://dans.knaw.nl/en/), the Dutch national centre of expertise and repository for research data
* [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/), the Dutch national data repository for science, engineering and design 
* [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) (NleSC), building and applying software to enhance the use of computing and digital technologies in academic research
* [Research Data Netherlands](https://researchdata.nl/en/) (RDNL), collaboration of SURF, 4TU.ResearchData, DANS and DTL to contribute to strengthening the National Programme Open Science, and helping create a FAIR research ecosystem across science fields, and its [Essentials 4 Data Support](https://datasupport.researchdata.nl/en/) Training 
* The [DTL Data Stewards Interest Group](https://www.dtls.nl/about/community/interest-groups/data-stewards-interest-group/) (DSIG), the Dutch (and beyond) community hub for data stewardship that enables informal and inclusive knowledge and experience exchange
* [NL-RSE](https://nl-rse.org/), the Dutch community of people writing and contributing to research software
* The Dutch [Open Science Communities](https://www.osc-nl.com/) (OSC), independent, bottom up local communities comprising members of various scientific disciplines and career stages, who want to learn more about Open Science
* [RDA-NL](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-netherlands), the Dutch Research Data Alliance Node 

## Assistance
* Researchers seeking practical assistance best check [RDM in the Netherlands](https://www.lcrdm.nl/en/rdm-in-the-netherlands), which provides information on the various local universities’ and university medical centers support desks
* Researchers can contact the [Health-RI service desk](https://www.health-ri.nl/health-ri-service-desk) for practical guidelines, tools and services, or the [ELSI servicedesk](https://elsi.health-ri.nl/) for ethical, legal and social issues
* The [X-omics helpdesk](https://x-omics.nl/helpdesk) provides researchers assistance with X-omics research infrastructure
