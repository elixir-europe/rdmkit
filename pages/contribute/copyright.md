This website aims to be unique and authoritative, but do feel free to include quotes and images from other resources if they add value to the page. Please follow the guidelines below if you do so and respect copyright. 

## Quoting from other resources

If you do need to quote from another resource, like a website or publication:

 - Enclose the quote within quotation marks
 - Keep the exact words
 - Link to the resource 
 - Give clear credit by naming the author (if known) and the resource
 - Give the full citation for a publication. 
 
Please do not copy the text and tweak the wording slightly. If you are not giving the exact quote, then you must express the concept in your own words. Avoid using long quotations from other resources. 

## Images

**It is your responsibility to make sure you have permission to use the images you put on the website.**

If you are using a stock image you have bought, or a royalty-free image, check the image license to make sure that you can use it on the RDMKit website. If you are using images provided by your institute or organisation, please also check that you can use them on this site.

You are welcome to create the images yourself, but please follow the [site style guide](style_guide), and bear in mind the image may be modified to better suite the style of the site.
