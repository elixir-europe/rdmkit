This is the main tool and resource list of our website. This is a curated list which means that not all tools or resources that exist for a certain topic are listed here. This is mainly because we do not intend to be a registry. In most cases you will only find back the tools or resources that are mentioned in the different pages. Most pages will show a filtered list of this main table at the end of the page. 

We link tools and resources to related information in ELIXIR registries: related policies and standards in FAIRsharing, scientific and technical descriptions of the resource in bio.tools, and related training in TeSS. If you see a missing link with one of the registries or a mistake, please open an [issue](https://github.com/elixir-europe/rdmkit/issues) or check our [how to add a tool or resource guide](tool_resource_update).

It is recommended to add:
- your training materials and events into the training registry [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/about/registering)
- your standards, databases and policies in [fairsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) registry
- your software tools, databases and services for bioinformatics and the life sciences in [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) registry
