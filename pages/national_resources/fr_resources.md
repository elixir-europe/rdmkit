## Introduction 

This is an overview of research data management resources in France. These resources are accessible for researchers in France and to their collaborators.

The french governement has set up the ["Committee for Open Science"](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/home/) that mobilises education and research stakeholders to support the implementation of National Open Science Policy.
The second [national plan for open science](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/get-started-with-open-science/) has been released in 2021.
