## Introduction
As a policy maker, you are responsible for the development of a strategic data management framework and the coordination and implementation of research data management guidelines and practices.

It is essential that you have knowledge of local, national and international data-related procedures and regulations. General data concepts have to be translated into practical guidelines for organisations and collaborative projects. 

Close collaboration with policy-related roles such as directors, project coordinators and funders is vital for this role.

## Data management responsibilities

As a policy maker you are coordinating and aligning efforts on the quality, security and management of institutional or collaborative project data. 

In your role of policy maker, you may need to:

* Advise, develop and monitor a RDM policy, institutionally or nationally;
* Ensure compliance of the RDM policy to codes of conduct and regulations, including ethical and legal compliance;
* Align the RDM policy to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles and the principles of Open Science;
* Identify the requirements of adequate data-infrastructure for RDM to comply with the institute’s RDM policy and alignment to (inter)national data-infrastructure and tools;
* Determine the adequate level of knowledge and skills on RDM;
* Maintain a network of aligned RDM expertise inside and outside the organisation or the collaborative project.
