## Introduction 
<!---General RDM considerations for your country, how to deal with RDM on a national level--->
This page provides an overview of data management resources in Luxembourg. The target audience is scientific community in life science. An overview of services provided by ELIXIR-LU can be found on [this webpage](https://elixir-luxembourg.org/services/catalog/).

## Funders
Luxembourgâ€™s main research funding body is the [Fonds National de la Recherche (FNR)](https://www.fnr.lu/). The FNR promotes open-access to scientific publication through its [open-access fund](https://www.fnr.lu/funding-instruments/open-access-fund/). To increase the re-usability of research outputs the FNR adopt a research data management policy and expects all funded projects to prepare and implement Data Management Plans (DMP) in line with Science Europe guidelines. [Data Management Plan guiding questions](https://storage.fnr.lu/index.php/s/urQOCMeKlgXexZF) are provided in FNR grant management system.

## Regulations
<!--- Ethical and legal regulations in the country, committees etc --->

## Research infrastructures and resources 
<!--- e.g. human data, covid-19. Please, only add domain-specific resources that you think don't fit in the table at the bottom--->
[ELIXIR Luxembourg](https://elixir-luxembourg.org) provides resources for life science data management, with the focus areas of translational biomedicine data hosting, data protection, data FAIRification and reproducible research. 

Luxembourg is part of [EATRIS](https://eatris.eu/countries/luxembourg/) and provides services in translational medicine. ELIXIR Luxembourg also provides the [TransMed tool assembly](transmed_assembly) to support research project with sensitive human data.

Luxembourg National Data Exchange Platform (PNED) is a government established infrastructure that provides services for the sharing and secondary use of data. PNED services are domain-agnostic, but includes lifesciences data management.  

[Uni.lu HPC](https://hpc.uni.lu/) and [EuroHPC MeluXina](https://luxprovide.lu/) offer high performance computing infrastructure combined with huge data storage capacity to Luxembourg public research. <!--Access: available to all research and industrial partners for the duration of joint projects. Related pages: data analysis, data storage. -->
