## Introduction 

This page provides a general overview of national resources on research data management (RDM) and Open Science in Sweden, directed towards researchers and official collaborators. National and long term data management goals and objectives are provided in the research and innovation bill [2024/25:60](https://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/a70996e2f9de4222b5a6880d33c20d35/forskning-och-innovation-for-framtid-nyfikenhet-och-nytta-prop.-20242560.pdf) (in Swedish). The Swedish ELIXIR node National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden ([**NBIS**](https://nbis.se/)) offers support and training in data management to life science researchers in Sweden, in collaboration with the [**Data Centre**](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/) at Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab).

## Policies and guidelines

The [**Swedish Research Council**](https://www.vr.se/) has a government mandate to coordinate and promote Sweden’s work on introducing [**open access**](https://www.vr.se/english/mandates/open-science/open-access-to-research-data.html) to research data, with the goal for transition to open access to research data to be fully implemented by 2026. As of 2019, all recipients of grants from the council are required to have a data management plan (DMP), written according to their [**DMP template**](https://www.vr.se/english/applying-for-funding/requirements-terms-and-conditions/producing-a-data-management-plan/data-management-plan-template.html), which is a partially revised version of Science Europe’s "Core Requirements for Data Management Plans".

[**Formas**](https://formas.se/) - The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning - has a [**policy**](https://formas.se/download/18.7357e3f3168752d5a10c7f7/1549956105856/Beslut_policy_oppna_data.pdf) on open access to research data, and requires that a [**DMP**](https://formas.se/soka-finansiering/sa-har-gar-det-till/att-kanna-till-nar-du-skriver-en-ansokan.html) is written and can be shown upon request.

The National Library of Sweden provides [national guidelines](https://www.kb.se/for-bibliotekssektorn/eng/open-science/national-guidelines-for-open-science.html) intended to provide support and guidance for the different stakeholders in Sweden who have overarching responsibility in the transition to open science. The purpose of these guidelines is to outline the direction for the continued development towards open science in Sweden, specifying which key actors are responsible for what, as well as how the guidelines are to be monitored and updated over time.

Many universities have established data and open access policies, for more information contact the Research Data Office (RDO) (see list at the end of the page).

## Authorities and Regulations

If personal data is processed in your research, contact your university’s or institute’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) (see list at the end of the page), for guidance on ethical and legal compliance. 

The following is a list of ethical and legal committees, authorities and regulations of interest:

### Authorities

* [Swedish Ethical Review Authority](https://etikprovningsmyndigheten.se/)
* [Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY)](https://www.imy.se/en/)

* [The Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400)](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/offentlighets-och-sekretesslag-2009400_sfs-2009-400/) (in Swedish)
* [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)

## Domain-specific infrastructures and resources 

The [**SciLifeLab Data Centre**](https://www.scilifelab.se/data) provides services for IT and data management, including Data Stewardship Wizard instance (for writing data management plans), the Swedish Pathogens Portal, and the SciLifeLab Data Repository. 

Data stewards at [**NBIS**](https://nbis.se/) (ELIXIR-SE) provide consultation and support services regarding data management questions, including e.g. guidance when writing data management plans and when doing submissions to domain-specific repositories. For information about this and other resources at NBIS please see the [**Data Management**](https://nbis.se/services/guidance-on-data-management) page. Regarding sensitive human data, an important resource is the [**FEGA Sweden**](https://fega.nbis.se/), a secure data archive and sharing platform for sensitive datasets, which will be integrated with the {% tool "the-european-genome-phenome-archive" %}.

The [**National Academic Infrastructure for Super­computing in Sweden**](https://www.naiss.se/) (NAISS) is a national research infrastructure that provides resources and user support for large-scale computation and data storage meeting the needs of researchers from all scientific disciplines and from all over Sweden. Of particular use for life science researchers is the [**NAISS-SENS**](https://supr.naiss.se/round/open_or_pending_type/?type=NAISS+SENS) project, which provides high-performance computing resources for analyzing sensitive data.

[**Swedish National Data Service**](https://snd.gu.se/en) (SND), with its network of almost 40 higher education institutions and public research institutes, provides researchers with a coordinated and quality-assured system for finding, describing, and sharing research data, nationally as well as internationally. The [**SND network**](https://snd.gu.se/en/about-us/snd-network) has agreed to create local units for managing research data (Data Access Units (DAUs)), with the main task to assist researchers in their respective organisation in making research data as accessible as possible, via training and support in data management. SND also provides a [**DMP checklist**](https://snd.gu.se/en/manage-data/guides/dmp-checklist) to support researchers in writing data management plans. In order to promote reuse and open access to data, SND has established [**researchdata.se**](https://researchdata.se/en), which serves as a portal for information on data management as well as a data catalogue to a variety of research fields.
